# Topic_Modelling_LDA
Topic modelling with LDA

The content has been gathered from news sites, containing the term "Monash University", or at least tagged with the label "Monash University" by an external annotator. This task is to perform appropriate text pre-processing and preparation and then perform two runs of LDA using the gensim.models.LdaModel()function call. Select appropriate choice of pre-processing and parameters to develop model outputs that are informative. Use visualisation of some kind to analyse and interpret the output of the topic model.

## Analysis code

Key elements of the analysis code are as follows:
- *Topic_modelling_LDA_NMF.ipynb* - a Python script used to build topic modelling modle.
- *Monash_crawled.csv* â€“ a csv file contains the content has been gathered from news sites, containing the term "Monash University", or at least tagged with the label "Monash University" by an external annotator.
