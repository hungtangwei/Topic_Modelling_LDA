 has experienced its worst air quality on record, as bushfire smoke 
became trapped by atmospheric conditions and residents were told to stay
 indoors and brace for more smog in the coming days.   The ACTas 
acting chief health officer, Dr Paul Dugdale, said the smoke was the 
worst since the 2003 bushfires and was acertainly the worsta since air 
quality monitoring started in the city 15 years ago.   Air quality 
index readings in Canberra city were at 3,463 on Wednesday afternoon, 
according to the ACT Health website. Ratings of more than 200 are 
considered hazardous. The suburb of Monash showed levels at 4,650 and 
Florey was at 3,508.   An ACT health spokesperson said the AQI 
reading for fine particles peaked at 7700 at 1am on Wednesday at the 
Monash monitoring site.   The Canberra-based University of NSW 
climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis was out in the city with her 
two-year-old daughter and said the conditions were alike nothing I have 
experienced beforea. She was planning to leave the city.   aItas permeating everything. It is the fine particulates that get through everything. This is the worst it has been,a she said.   aLast night it started to blow in and you do start to feel quite anxious and stressed. Smoke just makes us all panic.a   Families
 and children visiting Questacon, the National Science and Technology 
Centre, had a look of shock, said Lewis, with many people wearing masks 
and checking phone apps for air quality and fire updates.   Current
 location: Questacon. Heaps of young families trying to escape the 
smoke, but itas inside too. Everyone has this dazed, nearly 
panic-attacking face. Canat imagine the fear and anxiety for all who 
arenat safe  #AustraliaBurns   #ClimateEmergency    She said a pattern in recent weeks had been for the smoke
 from bushfires burning to the east to arrive on cooler sea breezes in 
the evening.   On Tuesday night and Wednesday, a phenomenon known as
 a atemperature inversiona had caused warmer air above to trap the 
smoke, making conditions especially bad.   The Bureau of Meteorology was expecting a similar temperature inversion to cause further problems in the ACT on Wednesday night.   On Wednesday morning Dugdale said 12 people had gone to Canberra hospital with smoke-related illnesses in the previous 24 hours.   Dugdale said it was not the time for people to start any new year fitness resolutions and they should stay indoors instead.   aThis is an exceptional time for Canberra a usually our air quality is among the best in the world,a he said.   The
 ACTas health directorate also issued fresh advice on Wednesday, saying 
all Canberrans should aavoid physical activity outsidea.   The public was advised to stay indoors with windows and doors closed and to turn evaporative air conditioners off.   The
 aextremely thicka smog was forecast to linger for several days, with 
conditions expected to remain poor, and temperatures on Saturday 
forecast to climb to 42C.   A statement said: aWe also strongly 
advise people who are sensitive to smoke, especially those with 
pre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during these 
conditions.   aPeople who are sensitive to smoke and air pollution 
can be more vulnerable to heat-related illness as well, so staying 
hydrated and cool is important.   aPeople who are able to do so, are
 also encouraged to check on others who they think might need extra 
help, to see that they are okay.a   In NSW on Wednesday, the air 
quality index was at very high hazardous levels of 2,300 around 
Goulburn, caused by smoke from nearby bushfires.   Hazardous 
conditions were also detected in regions of Sydneyas south-west (352), 
and in the central tablelands (394) and southwest slopes (360).  "

 dawn broke over a blackened Australian landscape Sunday, a picture 
emerged of disaster of unprecedented scale. The Rural Fire Service said  150 fires were active in the state, 64 of them uncontrolled .    Weather
 conditions eased, but more than 2,000 firefighters continued to fight 
the deadly fires that burned an area nearly the size of West Virginia in
 southeastern Australia.   For the first time in Australia's 
history, 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists have also been called
 up and will be thrown into the battle against the fires.   Prime 
Minister Scott Morrison announced the decision Saturday and committed 
almost $14 million to lease four fire-fighting aircraft for the duration
 of the wildfire crisis.   A mass of hot air moving across the 
country brought extreme heat and strong winds to New South Wales and 
Victoria on Saturday. Cooler and less windy conditions were expected on 
Sunday.     As many as 140,000 residents, in addition to tens of thousands of tourists, have been ordered to evacuate.

 Premier Daniel Andrews advised residents to leave and declared a state 
of disaster for six local government areas and Alpine resorts. It's the 
first time the emergency powers  have been used in Victoria , news.com.au reported.   New
 South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has declared a seven-day state 
of emergency starting at 9 a.m. Friday because of the ongoing crisis.   Across
 Australia, 23 people have died. The latest were killed on a fire on a 
highway on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia. More than 
1,400 homes have been destroyed in bushfires since October. Dozens of 
people are missing. More than 200 fires are burning in Victoria and New 
South Wales, Australia's two most-populous states.   Tourists
 in New South Wales on Thursday were ordered to leave a 
5,400-square-mile zone running from Nowra to the border with Victoria. 
Residents of the area have been told to be ready to leave.   It is 
the ""largest mass relocation of people out of the region that we've ever
 seen,"" NSW Minister for Transport Andrew Constance said.   The fires have closed dozens of roads, and officials urged drivers to stay on the main highways.   The
 Rural Fire Service said Emergency Services have started escorting 
vehicles on the Princes Highway between Milton and Nowra. The trip, 
which normally takes about 45 minutes, took six to seven hours.   About
 30 miles south of Milton, evacuees around Batemans Bay struggled to 
find fuel, and long lines formed at gas stations. Power outages also 
prevented stations from pumping gas.       The sun rises over the bushland of Cooma hill resort, south of Canberra, on Jan. 4, 2020.

Authorities said 381 homes had been destroyed on the state's southern coast this week, the AP reported.   ""These
 fires have already caused significant damage. They've caused 
significant loss, and our community needs to act now,"" Abbott said, 
according to news.com.au.   The HMAS  Choules  arrived off 
Mallacoota on Thursday morning to evacuate people who had gathered on 
the beach as bushfires surrounded the town on New Year's Eve. About 
4,000 people are thought to be in the town.   One local official 
said people wishing to drive out of Mallacoota with their own cars could
 be stuck for weeks because of road closures.   Data released 
Thursday from the Bureau of Meteorology show 2019 was Australia's 
hottest and driest year on record. December was Australia's hottest 
month on record. The average maximum temperature for the month was 101.3
 degrees Fahrenheit, 7.47 degrees above the 1961-1990 average.   Smoke from the bushfires has blanketed areas far from the blazes.   In Canberra, a woman died Thursday night after disembarking from a flight from Brisbane  onto a smoke-filled tarmac , the New Daily reported. Relatives think she went into respiratory distress after getting off the Qantas plane.   Air quality in Canberraas south reached a level more than 20 times above hazardous this week.   Across the Tasman Sea in New Zealand, dust and ash from the fires have  turned snow and glaciers brown,  the Guardian reported. Orange haze filled the skies over South Island.   Andrew
 Mackintosh, head of the school of earth, atmosphere and environment at 
Monash University and former director of the Antarctic Research Centre, 
estimated the dust could increase this seasonas glacier melt by 20 to 
30%.   aIt is quite common for dust to be transported to New Zealand
 glaciers, but I would say that the amount of transport right now is 
pretty phenomenal a I donat think Iave ever seen anything like it,a 
Mackintosh said. aIt is concerning to me to see so much material being 
deposited on the glaciers.a       1 of 223   A

1397549175,https://www.businessinsider.com/baby-milestones-first-six-months,2020-01-03,Key milestones your baby can reach in the first six months," Your baby's brain and body grow a lot during the first six months. 
While every baby develops at their own pace, experts say they should be 
hitting the below key milestones by month.   Until
 birth, babies have spent their entire lives in the quiet, darkness of 
their mother's womb. So, from the time they're born to about one month 
old, they're extremely sensitive to light and sound.    They will likely  respond 
 to lights, sounds, and faces by moving their gaze in the direction of 
the stimulus. In fact, most babies will just stare around a room, says  Atul Malhotra , a neonatologist at Australia's Monash University.    As the muscles in the baby's  neck  develop, you should start to see them  hold their head up  for very brief periods at two months of age.    Your baby might have smiled in their sleep or while passing gas before this time, but they'll have their first deliberate,  social smile  around their second month.    A baby will also start to pay attention to faces and  calm themselves  by  bringing their hand to their mouth . Malhotra adds that infants should start cooing or making other basic sounds at month two.    At 3 months old, your baby's  muscle coordination ,  taste buds , and  social skills  have grown, which means they can roll to the side, express disgust at unpleasant tastes or loud noises, and  vocalize when spoken to .   Chuckling and batting away objects also begins around this age.    By four months of age, your baby should  like to play with people  and  copy movements or facial expressions .    Bearing  weight on the legs  and  propping themself up on their elbows  occurs around this time as well, says Malhotra, thanks to their ever-growing motor skills and muscle strength.    A baby's depth perception and color vision  are more fully developed  by this age and they'll start to recognize and form attachments to their caregivers.    They'll also start to  respond to their name  and put their arms out when they fall.    Your child should  sit without support  and make both  consonant and vowel sounds .    They'll also begin  fearing strangers ,  understand the word ""no,""  and know  to respond when someone stops talking . Eating  soft solid foods  starts around this time too, Malhotra adds.    ""In
 my opinion, the most important milestones are smiling in response to 
interaction, head control in a variety of positions, and turning towards
 sounds,"" Malhotra says.    Your baby could be a late bloomer when it comes to smiling or lifting their head, but the CDC recommends  acting sooner 
 rather than later should children miss milestones. If your child isn't 
hitting the proper milestones around the recommended time, consult the 
child's pediatrician or your family physician. And if you still don't 
see progress soon, consider asking for a referral to a developmental 
specialist.  "

A
 study of nearly 4,000 people in India found those who inhaled more 
toxic airborne particles had less bone mass in their spines and 
hips.     Spanish researchers believe bones are weakened 
because tiny pollutants seep into the blood when inhaled and speed up 
the ageing process.      Previous studies have linked  pollution to low levels of parathyroid hormone, which regulates calcium production, leading to more fragile bones.    Living
 in polluted cities may make your bones weaker and easier to break. A 
study in India found people exposed to toxic particles had less bone 
density in their lower back (stock)    Smog-filled towns 
and cities have been linked to an increased risk of stroke, heart 
disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory diseases such as asthma and even
 dementia.     But there have only been a few studies into its effect on bone health and results have so far been inconclusive.     In
 the latest paper, researchers from the Barcelona Institute for 
Global Health looked at 3,700 people between 2009 and 2012.     Participants were all residents from 28 villages just outside the city of Hyderabad, in southern India.    Toxic
 airborne particles belted out of car exhausts and industry have 
been linked to an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, 
acute respiratory diseases such as asthma and even dementia.    They are thought to cause these conditions by seeping into the bloodstream when inhaled and causing inflammation.   Experts believe it weakens bones through the same mechanism.   The tiny particles speed up the ageing process and people's bones naturally become weaker as they age.   Previous studies have also linked  pollution to low levels of parathyroid hormone, which regulates calcium production, leading to more fragile bones.     Researchers took measurements of PM2.5 and black carbon in the atmosphere in each village.      PM2.5
 is the finest type of particulate matter, while black carbon is a 
larger toxin. Both come mainly from petrol and diesel vehicle 
exhausts.      Analysis revealed average PM2.5 
exposure was 33 micrograms per metre cubed (ug/m3) - far above the 
maximum 10ug/m3 levels recommended by the World Health 
Organisation.      By comparison, the average level is 13ug/m3 in London, 12ug/m3 in New York and 10ug/m3 in Sydney.     The
 researchers cross-referenced pollution levels with 
X-rays measuring bone mass in participant's lower back, known as 
the lumbar spine, and hip.      Results showed that exposure to air pollution was associated with lower levels of bone mass.      For
 every 3ug/m3 increase in fine particulate matter, there was a decrease 
of -0.57g of bone mass in the spine and -0.13g in the hip.     An increase of 1ug/m3 of carbon saw bone density shrink by -1.13g in the spine and -0.35g in the hip.      Study
 lead author Otavio Ranzani said: 'This study contributes to the limited
 and inconclusive literature on air pollution and bone 
health.       'Inhalation of polluting 
particles could lead to bone mass loss through the oxidative stress and 
inflammation caused by air pollution.' The findings were published in 
the journal  Jama Network Open .     Smog-filled
 towns and cities have been linked to an increased risk of stroke, heart
 disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory diseases such as asthma and 
even dementia     A 2017 study by Columbia 
University of more than nine million people was the first to find a link
 between traffic fumes and fractures caused by osteoporosis.     Osteoporosis is a health condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.     The
 study linked pollution exposure to low levels of parathyroid hormone, 
which regulates calcium production, leading to weaker bones and more 
hospitalizations for fractures.     It found hospital admissions for bone fractures were higher in communities with elevated levels of PM2.5.     More than 80 per cent of the world's urban population is breathing unsafe levels of air pollution.   Described
 as an invisible killer, it causes an estimated seven million premature 
deaths a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation.   Pollution
 is also fuelling increases in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's
 and other forms of dementia, health experts fear.   Previous studies have found air pollution has a negative impact on students' cognitive abilities.   Many pollutants are thought to directly affect brain chemistry in a variety of ways.   For
 instance, particulate matter from traffic and industry can carry toxins
 through small passageways and directly enter the brain.     CAUSE CHILDREN TO HAVE A LOW IQ :
 Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found in 
May 2019 that children born to mothers who live in polluted areas have 
an IQ that is up to seven points lower than those living in places with 
cleaner air.    CAUSE CHILDREN TO HAVE POORER MEMORY : Researchers
 at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health found boys exposed to 
greater levels of PM2.5 in the womb  performed worse on memory 
tests by the time they are 10.    DELAY THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN :
 Youngsters who live less than one-third of a mile away from busy roads 
are twice as likely to score lower on tests of communication skills in 
infancy, found researchers at Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute 
of Child Health in April. They were also more likely to have poorer 
hand-eye coordination.    MAKE CHILDREN MORE ANXIOUS : 
University of Cincinnati scientists claimed pollution may alter the 
structure of children's brains to make them more anxious. Their study of
 14 youngsters found rates of anxiety was higher among those exposed to 
greater levels of pollution.     CUT YOUR CHILD'S LIFE SHORT: 
 Children born today will lose nearly two years of their lives because 
of air pollution, according to a report by the US-based Health Effects 
Institute and the University of British Columbia in April 
2019. UNICEF called for action on the back of the study.    RAISE A CHILD'S RISK OF AUTISM:  Researchers
 at Monash University in Australia discovered youngsters living in 
highly polluted parts of Shanghai have a 86 per cent greater chance of 
developing ASD. Lead author Dr Yuming Guo said: 'The developing 
brains of young children are more vulnerable to toxic exposures in the 
environment.'    CAUSE ASTHMA IN CHILDREN : Four million 
children around the world develop asthma each year because of road 
traffic pollution, a major study by academics at George Washington 
University estimated. Experts are divided as to what causes asthma -
 but exposure to pollution in childhood increases the risk by damaging 
the lungs.    MAKE CHILDREN FAT : University of Southern 
California experts found last November that 10 year olds who lived in 
polluted areas when they were babies are, on average, 2.2lbs (1kg), 
heavier than those who grew up around cleaner air. Nitrogen dioxide 
pollution could disrupt how well children burn fat, the scientists 
said.     LEAVE WOMEN INFERTILE EARLIER : Scientists at the University of Modena, Italy, claimed in May 2019 that they believe  pollution
 speeds up ageing in women, just like smoking, meaning they run out of 
eggs faster. This was based on them finding almost two-thirds of women 
who have a low 'reserve' of eggs regularly inhaled toxic air.     RAISE THE RISK OF A MISCARRIAGE : University
 of Utah scientists found in January that pregnant women are 16 per cent
 more likely to suffer the heartbreak of a miscarriage if they live in 
areas of high pollution.        RAISE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER : Scientists
 at the University of Stirling found six women working at the same 
bridge next to a busy road in the US got breast cancer within three 
years of each other. There was a one in 10,000 chance the cases were a 
coincidence, the study said. It suggested chemicals in the traffic 
fumes caused the cancer by shutting down the BRCA genes, which try to 
stop tumours growing.     DAMAGE A MAN'S SPERM : 
Brazilian scientists at the University of Sao Paulo found in March that 
mice exposed to toxic air had lower counts and worse quality sperm 
compared to those who had inhaled clean air since birth.     MAKE MEN LESS LIKELY TO GET SEXUALLY AROUSED :
 Scientists at Guangzhou Medical University in China found rats exposed 
to air pollution struggled to get sexually aroused. Scientists believe 
it may also affect men, as inhaling poisonous particles may trigger 
inflammation in blood vessels and starve the genitals of oxygen a 
affecting men's ability to become sexually aroused.    MAKE MEN MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION :  Men
 who live on main roads are more likely to have difficulty getting an 
erection due to exposure to pollution, a Guangzhou University in China 
study suggested in February. Toxic fumes reduced blood flow to the 
genitals, tests on rats showed, putting them at risk of developing 
erectile dysfunction.     RAISE THE RISK OF PSYCHOSIS :
 In March, King's College London scientists linked toxic air to intense 
paranoia and hearing voices in young people for the first time. They 
said uncovering exactly how pollution may lead to psychosis should be an
 'urgent health priority'.    MAKE YOU DEPRESSED : 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers found in January that 
that the more polluted the air, the sadder we are. Their study was based
 on analysing social media users in China alongside the average daily 
PM2.5 concentration and weather data where they lived.    CAUSE DEMENTIA : Air
 pollution could be responsible for 60,000 cases of dementia in the UK, 
researchers from King's College London and St George's, University of 
London, calculated last September. Tiny pollutants breathed deep into 
the lungs and enter the blood stream, where they may travel into 
the brain and cause inflammation a a problem which may trigger dementia.  "

power a phone for five continuous days, or allow an electric vehicle to 
travel more than 1,000km without needing to recharge.   The groundbreaking energy storage is made possible by ditching lithium-ion  batteries  a used in everything from iPhones to pacemakers a and replacing them with lithium-sulfur batteries.   Theoretically, lithium-sulfur batteries are capable of holding up to five-times more energy than  lithium-ion ones , but until now they have been wildly impractical for use in consumer electronics.   Sharing the full story, not just the headlines   The biggest challenge until now with lithium-sulfur batteries has
 been the instability of the cathode, which undergoes a 78 per cent 
change in size each time it goes through a charge cycle.   This means the batteries degrade extremely quickly and do not last long enough for them to be recharged over and over again.

    Researchers at Monash University in Australia discovered that 
using a very flexible cathode allowed it to handle the expansion 
and contraction without significant degradation. In doing so, they claim
 to have created the ""world's most efficient"" lithium-sulfur battery.   aThe world needs radical new  energy storage 
technologies to fight climate change,a Dr 
Mahdokht Shaibani from Monash Universityas Department of 
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told  The Independent .      aLithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely 
high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as 
traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials 
that are available worldwide.a    Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: aThis approach not only 
favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can 
lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.a   The research, which is published in  Science Advances , could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.   Dr Shaibani said the commercialisation of the batteries may 
be between two to four years away, and a patent for the 
manufacturing process has already been approved.   Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further 
testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this 
year.   aCost projections and performance metrics of our technology 
predicts for outperforming todayas lithium-ion batteries at high 
competitive price points,a said Dr Shaibani.    aAltogether, this means that solar power could be much more 
easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more 
importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.aa  "
1397814110,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7849505/Scientists-missing-link-allergic-reactions-popular-skin-creams.html,2020-01-03,Scientists find 'missing link' in allergic reactions to cosmetics," Scientists
 have discovered a specific protein that triggers allergic reactions 
when it comes into contact with fragrances common in cosmetic 
products.     It can send immune cells into overdrive when people use skin creams, body washes, lotions, shampoos - and even toothpastes.   The
 breakthrough could help stem soaring cases of rashes, lumps, blisters, 
itchy eyes and facial swellings. It has been dubbed the 'molecular 
missing link'.   An average woman uses 12 cosmetic items a day - containing an estimated 168 different chemicals.   And
 as these products become increasingly common, scientists have noted 
that contact dermatitis - a kind of allergic reaction that causes a red,
 itchy rash skin touches certain substances - has also been on the 
rise.    Contact dermatitis has been on the rise as the 
skin care and cosmetic industry has grown. Now, scientists understand 
how common fragrances trigger a protein to cause the rash    The
 key protein, called CD1a, is found in immune cells that form the outer 
layer of human skin. It offers hope of developing drugs that block it.   Experiments
 showed it binds directly to allergens, or irritants, found in personal 
care products - triggering the immune system's T cells.   These 
white blood cells kill foreign invaders. Allergies stem from mistaken 
identity, when they respond to benign substances that would otherwise be
 harmless.   Co senior author Professor David Branch Moody, of the 
division of rheumatology, inflammation and immunity at Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in the United States, explained: ""What we present here 
is a molecular missing link.""   Compounds found in skin creams and other cosmetics can cause ACD (allergic contact dermatitis), he said.   The common condition is on the rise, particularly in industrialized countries. But the exact reasons remain unclear.   Most
 allergies involving T cells are attributed to proteins or synthetically
 produced peptide antigens that set off the immune system.   But 
chemicals found in personal care products are different kinds of 
molecules that were not thought to be able to directly elicit a 
reaction.   The latest findings, published in the journal Science 
Immunology, uncover the way in which components of everyday consumer 
products do just this.   They shed light on the mystery behind the rise in cases of ACD, say the international team.   Prof
 Moody said: ""We questioned the prevailing paradigm that T cell-mediated
 allergic reaction is only triggered when T cells respond to proteins or
 peptide antigens.   ""We find a mechanism through which fragrance can initiate a T cell response through a protein called CD1a.""   Dermatologists
 have been puzzled for years as to how allergies are triggered by many 
substances found in soaps, cosmetics, fragrances, jewellery and plants.   The
 molecules were thought to be too small and of the wrong chemical 
structure to be detected directly by T cells - the immune cells that 
fuel ACD.   Co study leader Dr Annemieke de Jong, a skin 
immunologist at Columbia University, New York, and colleagues wondered 
if there might be another explanation.   So first author Dr Sarah 
Nicolai, MD, a research fellow in medicine at Brigham, exposed T cells 
to material from skin patch testing kits used in allergy clinics.   This showed they responded to certain substances including balsam of Peru - widely used in cosmetics and toothpaste.   The
 researchers further identified ingredients within the tree oil - benzyl
 benzoate and benzyl cinnamate - that were directly responsible for 
stimulating the reaction.   They also tested similar substances and found a dozen small molecules that appeared to elicit a response.   These
 included farnesol - an alcohol used in a host of products including 
deodorants, anti ageing creams, shower gels and shampoos.   Using 
scanning techniques, further analysis by investigators at Monash 
University, Melbourne, revealed farnesol and CD1a combine to destroy 
naturally occurring blood fats. This makes the protein more visible to T
 cells - helping to activate them.   The researchers now plan to see if patients commonly have T cells that recognise molecules like farnesol.   They
 also seeking new molecules that could block the response of CD1a and 
override the activation of T cells. Work is currently underway to 
identify promising compounds.  "

chemical compounds in creams and cosmetics cause rashes in the skin, 
suggesting a new way to treat the allergic condition.   The study published this week in the journal Science Immunology 
showed that an abundant molecule on the immune cells in the skin's outer
 layer exposes those chemicals to T cells that orchestrate the immune 
system's response to foreign chemicals.   Why some chemicals trigger dermatitis was a mystery, since small 
chemicals have to bind to a larger protein in order to become visible to
 T cells, but few chemicals do this by undergoing a chemical reaction 
inside our body.   Researchers at Columbia University, the Brigham and Women's Hospital,
 Cardiff University and Monash University found that several common 
chemicals known to trigger allergic contact dermatitis were able to bind
 to molecules called CD1a on the surface of skin immune cells and then 
activate T cells.   The chemicals include Balsam of Peru and farnesol, which are found in
 many personal care products, such as skin creams, toothpaste, and 
fragrances.   CD1a molecules bind the skin's own naturally occurring lipids in its 
tunnel-like interior. Those lipids protrude from the tunnel, creating a 
physical barrier that prevents CD1a from interacting with T cells, 
according to the study.   Farnesol, however, was shown to hide inside the tunnel of CD1a, 
displacing the resident natural lipids, making the CD1a surface visible 
to the T cells and resulting in an immune reaction.   The discovery offers a new idea for treatment as the allergic 
condition might be stopped by applying competing lipids to the skin to 
displace those triggering the immune reaction.   "

 bushfire smoke has delivered orange skies to New Zealand, prompting 
street lights to turn on and a flood of calls to emergency services.   NZ
 Police on Sunday asked people to stop calling the national emergency 
line, triple one, to report the haze as it crossed the North Island.   ""We are currently receiving high numbers of calls related to this,"" the force said in a statement.   The
 thick plume, originating more than 2200 kilometres away and painted 
Auckland orange, began to thin out over the country's biggest city about
 7pm.   ""Smoke will remain overnight but the main plume appears to have moved through,"" Weather Watch NZ said.   MetService,
 the national weather bureau, said an upper-level jet of westerly winds 
drove the smoke to NZ but southerly winds should clear the worst of the 
smoke on Monday.   ""That point in the mid-afternoon in January when
 all the lights come on,"" author David Slack posted to Twitter, with a 
photo of Auckland's skyline.   ""It's only 2020. How bad will this be later in the century if we don't do something?"" Lauren McLean tweeted from Hamilton.   Monash
 University experts this weekend have reported that glaciers in NZ have 
turned brown after being exposed to the smoke, dust and ash which has 
drifted from Australia.   The NZ defence minister on Sunday confirmed the nation would send military support across the ditch to aid bushfire management.   The assistance will include personnel and three NZ Air Force helicopters.   The
 contingent will deploy to Royal Australian Air Force Base Edinburgh, in
 Adelaide, and will remain in Australia at least until the end of 
January, minister Ron Mark said.     Advertisement    "

 firefighters are celebrating a reprieve this week from some of the most
 devastating infernos in Australian history, there is foreboding about 
what's to come with a grim long-range forecast.     Fire 
season typically peaks with the so-called 'February Dragon' - the 
hottest and driest month when the nation has been hit by the likes of 
Black Saturday and Ash Wednesday.     But it's only 
January 6 and 23 people have already died this season, six more are 
missing and at least 1500 homes destroyed, and six million hectares of 
land razed.    Meanwhile, the Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) 
long-range climate outlook predicts above average temperatures and below
 average rainfall - horrible fire conditions - for much of the east 
through until at least the end of March.    This week: 
Cool conditions will give way to hot weather hitting the low 40s 
(purple) on Friday - with the heatwave increasing fire danger in the 
central west of New South Wales   Isn't this enough? 
Thick plumes of smoke tower into the sky as fires ravage East Gippsland 
at the weekend, via the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's 
Challenger jet   Weatherzone meteorologist Tom Hough said: 
'Warmer than average and drier than average is the trend that looks to 
be continuing.      'Based off the climate outlooks it doesn't look like we're going to see any significant rainfall.'    A
 BOM graphic shows virtually the entire east coast shaded in red, 
showing the region has a greater than 80 per cent chance of topping the 
median temperature.    A separate graphic shows New South Wales
 and Queensland are expected to experience below average or average 
rainfall.     Long-range temperature forecast: It's
 very likely to be hot on the east coast through to March, with a four 
in five chance the median maximum temperature will be exceeded   Long
 range RAIN forecast: While the west and south coasts of Australia are 
predicted to get some relief, the east coast is likely to be dry or 
receive about average rain   The outlooks are not gospel, and 
given the long big dry, another expert has warned of the risks of floods
 should notoriously unpredictable drought-breaking rain hit.     In a piece for  The Conversation ,
 Monash University emeritus professor Neville Nicholls wrote that big 
deluges, such as the ones that broke the Millenium Drought, tend to hit 
between January and May.    'We all hope the rain arrives 
sooner rather than later, and eases the fire situation. But rain will 
bring other risks,' Prof Nicholls wrote.    'Continental-scale 
droughts such as that experienced over the past few years are often 
broken by widespread heavy rains, leading to an increased risk of 
flooding including potentially lethal flash floods.'   Prof 
Nicholls, who worked for the Bureau of Meteorology for 35 years, said 
that, perversely, the devastating blazes would make flooding 
worse.    'The flood risk is exacerbated by the bare soil and 
lack of vegetation caused by drought, and by bushfires that destroy 
forest and grassland,' he wrote.     Perversely, 
the devastating bushfires will create better conditions for floods if 
drought-breaking rain hits, a climate expert says   1500
 homes have destroyed in this season's blazes - this one the recent 
victim of the devastating Gospers Mountain fire near the New South Wales
 central coast   Monash University emeritus Professor Neville Nicholls is a 35 year veteran of the Bureau of Meteorology   He also warned the traditional summertime risk of cyclones hasn't gone away and there is the further risk of heatwaves.    Prof Nicholls said Australia has already suffered through severe heatwaves this summer, but it may get worse.    'However they usually peak in the middle and end of summer, so the worst may be yet to come.'   Temperatures
 have cooled across the eastern seaboard, but are expected to hit the 
high 30s and low 40s in New South Wales's central west, the state's 
Rural Fire Service (RFS) said on Monday.     'The more 
benign weather conditions ... presents wonderful relief for everybody, 
the firefighters, emergency services personnel but the communities 
affected by the fires also,' commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons 
said.     Mr Fitzsimmons said the worsening conditions 
later this week will create a severe fire risk on the west side of Great
 Dividing Range. Thankfully, firefighters do not expect severe or 
worse fire danger ratings for the NSW south coast this week.    At
 the same time, Tropical Cyclone Blake has formed off the north-west 
coast of Australia - in a development expected to help bring rain across
 the country's west and south in the coming weeks.    Now a CYCLONE: Tropical Cyclone Blake, a category two storm, has formed off the north-west coast of Australia near Karratha    SYDNEY      TUESDAY: Min 22.

 them handle higher loads without decreases in capacity, performance or 
stability. The technique was derived from the bridging architectures you
 see in processing detergent powders, the university said.   The challenge is to get the battery to production. Many researchers have touted  battery breakthroughs 
 that never seem to reach shipping products. There's a lot of work 
involved in bringing batteries to market, whether it's refining the 
design or finding a way to produce it in large volumes, and many of 
these inventions either don't escape the lab or are stuck there for 
years.   The Monash team may be closer than most to offering a 
practical product, mind you. Germany's Fraunhofer Institute has already 
produced test batteries, and scientists plan to test the design in cars 
and solar power grids in Australia later in 2020. They've also received a
 patent for the invention. It could still take a long time before the 
tech reaches the real world. If and when it does, though, it could not 
only reduce battery hassles for mobile devices, but make it  easier to justify EVs  for those wary of range limits and long-term environmental costs.  "

half a billion animals have died as a result of wildfires across 
Australia. And while the situation remains out of control, one expert 
has said that, thanks to climate change, things could get worse before 
they get better for Australia. Neville Nicholls, professor emeritus of 
the School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment at Monash University, 
Australia, believes the fires will pave the way for worst conditions.   For
 starters, with much of the south of the country scorched, there is 
little in the way of flood defence when the heavy rain arrives, with 
Prof Nicholls saying there are anow signs of cyclonic activity in the 
near future.a   In an article for the Conversation, Prof Nicholls 
wrote: aThe flood risk is exacerbated by the bare soil and lack of 
vegetation caused by drought, and by bushfires that destroy forest and 
grassland.   aFurther south, drought-breaking rains can also be heavy and widespread, leading to increased flood risk.   aSo
 even when the drought breaks and rains quell the fires, there will

 summer has only just began for Australia, and the scorching heat is yet
 to peak, with it typically doing so around the beginning of February.   When even hotter temperatures arrive, the wildfires could become even worse.   And
 as global warming continues to warm the globe, Prof Nicholls said 
droughts, heatwaves and cyclones could become even worse for the 
antipodean nation.   He continued: aWe are still a month away from the riskiest time for heatwaves in southern Australia.

 thing we all desire from our smartphones today is that it lasts long --
 just like they used to - during the era of feature phones when a single

 published in Science Advances, researchers at Monash Universityas 
Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering have developed a new 
battery using lithium and sulphur that can easily outperform current 
lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries by four times.    Dr Mahdokht Shaibani is leading this project with Professor Mainak Majumder and Associate Professor Matthew Hill.    Theyare
 using the same materials used in standard lithium-ion batteries, 
however, theyave changed the configuration to use sulfur cathodes that 
enable higher stress loads without dropping overall capacity and 
performance of the batteries.   The application of these batteries 
are not just limited to smartphones, they can also be applied to 
electric cars, thus extending a vehicleas range and performance without 
the need of recharging it over and over again.      Rawpixel     Professor

1400306614,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7856759/Scientists-develop-battery-smartphone-running-five-days.html,2020-01-06,New sulfur battery that can keep a smartphone running for five days," Scientists
 have created what they say is the world's most efficient 
lithium-sulphur battery, capable of providing power to a smartphone for 
five continuous days.   The Australian developers say the battery, 
which uses low-cost sulphur in its electrodes, could also power an 
electric vehicle to drive more than 620 miles.   The Australian 
researchers responsible have filed a patent for the technology, which 
could outperform leading battery manufacturers by more than four times 
if commercialised.   Sulphur has great potential in battery 
technology due to its high energy density a lithium-sulphur batteries 
are capable of storing up to 10 times more energy than lithium-ion 
batteries.    But lithium-sulphur batteries lose their charging
 capacity drastically over charging and discharging cyclea, due to an 
increase in volume of the electrode, causing it to fall apart.   The
 team therefore created bonds between sulphur particles to give them 
more space to expand and contract, giving the battery greater longevity.    Scroll down for    video      Associate Professor Matthew Hill, Dr Mahdokht Shaibani and Professor Mainak Majumder with the lithium-sulphur battery design   The
 research marks an important step towards full commercialisation of 
lithium-sulphur batteries, which have great potential if scientists can 
overcome their instability during charging cycles.   The team now 
has backing from international partners to bring the technology to 
market after more tests this year, potentially giving power-slurping 
smartphones the battery capacity of the legendary long-lasting Nokia 
3310.      Lithium-sulphur batteries can provide an energy intensity five times higher than that of lithium-ion batteries.   However,
 the commercialisation of lithium-sulphur has had many obstacles, 
including a short cycle life, low cycling efficiency and poor safety.   The
 main challenges of lithium-sulphur batteries is the low conductivity of
 sulphur and its massive volume change during charging.   This volume change a as much as 78 per cent a can lead to a progressive loss of cohesion of sulphur particles.   This
 can mean it reaches lower charging capacities of lithium-ion batteries 
before the electrode just falls apart and the lithium-sulphur battery 
stops working.   Sulphur is, however, very cheap and abundant and has a relatively low atomic weight and a high energy density.   Lithium-sulphur
 batteries could potentially displace lithium-ion batteries by 
delivering higher specific energy a or the energy per unit mass.   To
 manufacture lithium-sulphur batteries, scientists replace the lithium 
electrode a the bit of metal that carries the electrical current a of a 
lithium-ion battery with a carbon-sulphur 
combination.             'Successful
 fabrication and implementation of lithium-sulphur batteries in cars and
 grids will capture a more significant part of the estimated $213 
billion value chain of Australian lithium, and will revolutionise the 
Australian vehicle market and provide all Australians with a cleaner and
 more reliable energy market,' said Professor Mahdokht Shaibani from 
Monash University in Australia.   'Our research team has received 
more than $2.5 million in funding from government and international 
industry partners to trial this battery technology in cars and grids 
from this year, which we're most excited about.'   Lithium-sulphur 
batteries have less of an impact on the environment than current 
lithium-ion products due to its use of water-based processes.   They
 can provide an energy intensity five times higher than that of 
lithium-ion batteries, which are commonly used for portable electronics 
and electric vehicles.   Sulphur is cheap, abundant and often the by-product of many industrial processes such as the processing of natural gas.   But the potential of the material in batteries is yet to be fully realised.   The
 problem of lithium-sulphur batteries is that the capacity of the 
sulphur electrode a the bit of metal in the battery that carries the 
electrical current a is so large that it breaks apart over multiple 
charging and discharging cycles.   Sulphur is cheap and abundant due to being a by-product of many industrial processes including    Lithium-sulphur
 batteries, once scaled up in size, could enable an electric vehicle to 
drive more than 620 miles without needing to 'refuel' with more 
electricty    This is due to a change in volume that 
occurs in a lithium-sulphur electrodes is around 78 per cent a about 
eight times higher than that of electrodes in lithium ion batteries, 
causing a loss of cohesion of particles and therefore loss of power 
capacity.   The Monash team reconfigured the design of sulphur 
cathodes so they can accommodate higher stress loads without a drop in 
capacity or performance.   To do this, they engineered a method that
 creates bonds between particles to accommodate stress a giving them 
more space to expand and contract a and therefore deliver higher 
stability.   'This approach not only favours high performance 
metrics and long cycle life, but is also simple and extremely low-cost 
to manufacture, using water-based processes, and can lead to significant
 reductions in environmentally hazardous waste,' said Associate 
Professor Matthew Hill, co-author of the research paper, which has been 
published in   Science Advances  .   Lithium-sulphur
 batteries and can lead to reductions in environmentally hazardous waste
 compared to lithium-ion batteries (pictured) used for mobile phones   The team said their battery could also be used in computers and solar grids.   Battery
 manufacturers in Europe and China are interested in upscaling 
production after further testing, which takes place in Australia this 
year.   The researchers have had a patent for the technology 
approved filed patent, and prototype cells have been successfully 
fabricated by Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology in 
Germany.  "

Their cousin, who shared the video originally, said they left behind any animals that seemed to be OK,  according to LadBible .   They reported that around 60 percent of the koalas they came across had burned to death.   One fifth of the koalas they saved died within the first day due to their injuries.   The video was shared on Reddit with the caption: ""Amid the  terrible bushfires in Australia , my cousins went out and saved as many koalas as they could. Good on 'em.""

He ran towards the raging fire, picking up the stricken animal before rushing it to safety.   Sam captured the heartwarming moment in a video which he shared with his 106,000 followers on Instagram.   In the video he said ""I found a baby joey in the fire"" before putting him the front seat of his truck.   He then wrapped the little marsupial in a blanket before giving it some much needed water and rushing it to the vet.   He said: ""Everyone meet my little baby.   ""I saved him out of the fire today.

1400373506,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/tech/lithium-sulfur-battery-scli-intl-scn/index.html,2020-01-06,"New lithium-sulfur battery could charge your phone for five days, researchers say ","  London (CNN Business) Australian researchers claim they have developed a battery that can keep a  smartphone  charged for five days or power an electric car for 1,000 kilometers (over 600 miles).   If
 the technology comes to be used widely, it would represent a 
significant breakthrough in the hunt for greener, more efficient energy.
    The team from Monash University in Melbourne says the 
lithium-sulfur battery it has created is the ""world's most efficient,"" 
and can outperform traditional batteries by four times.   The
 researchers said they are ""on the brink"" of commercializing the 
innovation, and touted its benefits for the fight against climate 
change.   Most commercial batteries are lithium-ion, but 
lithium-sulfur alternatives have long been attractive because of their 
higher energy density and ability to power objects for longer.   However,
 lithium-sulfur batteries tend to have a far shorter lifespan. They are 
used in some aircraft and cars, but previous attempts to bring them to 
mass production and phase out lithium-ion batteries have failed.   According
 to battery experts The Faraday Institution, the widespread use of 
lithium-sulfur batteries faces ""major hurdles"" stemming from sulfur's 
""insulating nature,"" and degradation of the metallic lithium anode.     The team in Australia, whose research was published in the journal  Science Advances ,
 reconfigured the design of sulfur cathodes so that they are able to 
withstand higher stress loads without seeing a drop in overall 
performance.   Their work ""will revolutionise the Australian vehicle
 market and provide all Australians with a cleaner and more reliable 
energy market,"" lead researcher Professor Mainak Majumder said in a 
press release.   The group, whose work received funding from the 
Australian government, has patented the new battery and further testing 
is scheduled for later this year.   ""This
 approach not only favours high performance metrics and long cycle life,
 but is also simple and extremely low-cost to manufacture, using 
water-based processes, and can lead to significant reductions in 
environmentally hazardous waste,"" Matthew Hill, who also worked on the 
team, said.   However, the there are some challenges and limitations associated with the technology.    CNN's Amy Woodyatt contributed to this report.  "
1400471875,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/aap/article-7855283/Rain-cool-crucial-bushland-recovery.html,2020-01-06,"Rain, cool crucial to bushland recovery","    Published:    12:41 AEDT, 6 January 2020     |    Updated:    12:41 AEDT, 6 January 2020        Rain and cooler conditions will be crucial for Australia's bushfire-charred landscape to recover, leading experts say.   About seven million hectares of land has already burnt across Australia, with lives lost and homes destroyed.   The
 time needed for vegetation to recover is unknown and will also depend 
on the severity of the fires in different areas, CSIRO principal 
research scientist Andrew Sullivan says.   ""Within 12 months you 
will find most areas covered in a green sheen, in new spouts and 
coverage,"" Dr Sullivan told AAP on Monday.   ""If you continue to go
 into drought, the response of the trees is going to be affected. If you
 get some good rain ... the response from the native vegetation is that 
much better.""   Vegetation at the front of bushfires is likely to 
be burnt through, while vegetation burnt by a fire's flank should bounce
 back fairly quickly, he said.   Trees may be killed if the flames 
scorch the crown - the top of the tree - but new shoots may grow at 
their base almost immediately. Partly-burnt trees may start to regrow 
about midway up the trunk.   Monash University senior lecturer 
Christoph Rudiger, whose research involves using satellites to model the
 spread of bushfires, agrees the time frame for recovery is still 
unknown.   ""You should see some sprouting in a few months if it is 
the usual (type of fire). The recovery depends on what the weather and 
climate does,"" Dr Rudiger said.   Burnt vegetation may take three 
to five years to recover properly if other fires across the country in 
the past five years are a guide, Dr Rudiger said.   ""If it 
continues to be dry like it is now, the remaining vegetation will burn 
as well and the recovery to that burnt vegetation now will take much 
longer,"" he said.   Dr Rudiger is pushing for a dedicated research 
centre for bushfire recovery, rather than the Bushfire and Natural 
Hazard Cooperative Research Centre, to better utilise expert knowledge.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison flagged the need for more hazard reduction 
across the country while announcing the National Bushfire Recovery 
Agency on Sunday.   Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was asked on 
Melbourne radio about backburning in bushland before the fires, after a 
royal commission proposed a minimum annual burn of public land.   ""You
 can only put fire into the landscape when it is safe to do so. You have
 to the hectares the climate allows you to do,"" Premier Daniel Andrews 
told 3AW radio.   ""Not just some broad hectare count to make you feel good, you have to be really careful.""     Advertisement    "

'Based off the climate outlooks it doesn't look like we're going to see any significant rainfall.'    In a piece for  The Conversation ,
 Monash University emeritus professor Neville Nicholls 
said Australia has already suffered through severe heatwaves this

 (Reuters) - Australiaas government is sticking firmly to a position 
that there is no direct link between climate change and the countryas  
devastating bushfires, despite public anger, the anguish of victims and 
warnings from scientists.    Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his 
emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, say Australia does not need 
to cut carbon emissions more aggressively to limit global warming, even 
after a three-year drought and unprecedented bushfires.    Instead 
they say Australia, which contributes 1.3% of the worldas carbon 
emissions but is the second-largest emitter per capita behind the United
 States, should be rewarded for beating its emissions reduction targets 
for 2020.    aWhen it comes to reducing global emissions, Australia 
must and is doing its bit, but bushfires are a time when communities 
must unite, not divide,a Taylor said in emailed comments to Reuters on 
Tuesday, while he was busy at bushfire relief centers in his 
constituency in New South Wales state.    Stepping up efforts to cut
 emissions would harm the economy, the government argues, especially if 
it hurt Australiaas exports of coal and gas. The country last year 
overtook Qatar as the worldas top exporter of liquefied natural gas.    aIn
 most countries it isnat Aacceptable to pursue emissionAreduction 
policies that add substantially to the cost of living, Adestroy jobs, 
reduce incomes and impede growth,a Taylor wrote in The Australian 
newspaper on Dec. 31.    aThatas why we wonat adopt (opposition) 
Laboras uncosted, reckless, economy-destroying targets that will always 
result in a tax on Aenergy, whether it is called that or not.a    Taylor did not detail exactly how cutting emissions would raise the cost of living.     Australians
 have complained that due to a lack of energy policy, power prices have 
risen substantially in recent years placing a heavy burden on household 
incomes, even as energy producers are gradually shifting to cheaper 
renewables.    Tayloras came in response to criticism Australia 
faced at the United Nations climate summit in Madrid for blocking 
ambitious action to cut carbon emissions.    Environmental groups 
say Australia will only meet its emissions targets by including old 
carbon credits the government wants to count from the 1992 Kyoto 
Protocol.    Scientists say climate change is a key factor in the destructive wildfires.    aOne
 of the key drivers of fire intensity, fire spread rates and fire area 
is temperature. And in Australia weave just experienced record high 
temperatures,a said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change 
Institute at Australian National University.    The burning forests 
are a double whammy for the environment, as they add to carbon emissions
 while also removing carbon sinks which will take decades to grow back, 
said David Holmes, director of the Monash University Climate Change 
Communication Research Hub.    Australiaas bushfires since September
 have emitted about 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equal to 
two-thirds the countryas annual emissions from man-made sources, 
estimated Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, based on 
data from NASA satellites.    To others, from opposition Labor to 
film star Russell Crowe, who skipped the Golden Globes awards to fight 
bushfires in Australia, to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the link is 
clear  between climate change and Australiaas fires which have killed 25
 people, destroyed thousands of homes and razed more than 8 million 
hectares (20 million acres) of land since September.         FILE

are delaying action on climate change: look at the blood-red sky and 
unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires,a Sanders 
said on social media last week.     Amid an outbreak of fires in 
several states in November, Labor leader Anthony Albanese urged Morrison
 to beef up resources to prepare for, fight and prevent disasters.    aThe
 fire season is starting earlier and finishing later, and emergency 
leaders agree that extreme weather events in Australia will only 
increase in severity and frequency, due to climate change,a Albanese 
wrote in the Nov. 22 letter, which he posted on social media.    Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Michael Perry  "

Tens of thousands of people have been  evacuated from their homes  in New South Wales and Victoria, in some cases only with  help from the Australian navy .    Serious fires have also burned in South Australia, where three people
 have died, Western Australia and Queensland. By the end of the first 
week of January,  more than    8.4m hectares (20.8m acres) had been burned  across the whole country a an area bigger than the size of Scotland.   Satellite data from Nasa showed a stark increase in the number of 
fire detections in November and December compared with previous years. 
Satellites detect fire ahotspotsa by measuring the infrared radiation 
emitted by the blazes.   In previous years, between 2,000 and 3,000 such hotspots were 
recorded each December in the south-east, while in 2019 the number 
reached 227,000.    The fires have had catastrophic effects on the local wildlife,  killing millions of animals and threatening the survival of entire species .   Smoke plumes posed a significant health threat even to those living miles away, as the wind carried heavily polluted air to  Sydney  and  Canberra , and  as far as New Zealand .   Wildfire smoke contains poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide and 
fine particles known as PM2.5 which pass through the lungs and can harm  virtually every organ in the human body .   A monitoring site in the Monash suburb of Canberra measured an air 
quality index of 5,185 on Friday, more than 20 times the level that is 
considered hazardous.   The devastation from the bushfires has been fuelled by the global 
climate crisis. Last year was Australiaas warmest on record and followed
 a clear long-term trend. It was also the driest year on record.   The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  concluded more than a decade ago  that human-caused global heating was avirtually certaina to increase the intensity and frequency of fires in Australia.   aAs a climate scientist, the thing that really terrifies me is that 
weather conditions considered extreme by todayas standards will seem 
sedate in the future,a  wrote Dr JoA&lt; .     aWhatas unfolding right now is really just a taste of the new normal.a  "

 made via Twitter on 4 January (and reiterated to reporters on 5 
January), that his forces have atargeted 52 Iranian sitesa some of which
 are aimportant to Iran &amp; the Iranian culturea. Whatever the policy 
implications of these words, we respond with horror to direct threats 
against the people of Iran and against their tangible and intangible

inflammatory statement is contrary to the stated aims of the 1954 Hague 
convention and the protocols of the Geneva conventions of 1949 and 1977.
 Furthermore, the international criminal court considers the destruction
 of cultural heritage to be a war crime.   We stand in solidarity 
with the people of Iran and state our support, at this time of great 
anxiety, for our friends and colleagues in Iranas museums, universities 
and heritage organisations. Their mission is of fundamental national and
 international importance a they work to create, safeguard and interpret
 an invaluable material legacy for present and future generations.   As

 of bushfire devastation has left million of hectares burnt across 
Australia, more than 20 dead and thousands of properties lost, but a 
wider, less visible impact is expected, and experts have started to 
weigh in on what the future looks like around the country.   Original
 reports suggested that 500 million animals had already perished in the 
blazes, and WWF-Australia now estimates that number is higher than one 
billion.   ""Australia is a land of bushfires, but this season's 
unprecedented mega fires are not normal. Climate change does not cause 
bushfires, but it does make them much worse,"" WWF-Australia CEO Dermot 
O'Gorman said in a statement.   ""This heart-breaking loss includes 
thousands of precious koalas on the mid-north coast of NSW, along with 
other iconic species such as kangaroos, wallabies, gliders, potoroos, 
cockatoos and honeyeaters.""   The loss of wildlife comes hand in 
hand with the damage of national forests and millions of trees, 
releasing enormous volumes of carbon dioxide that are already affecting 
air quality.   The Australian Medical Association has warned of new
 health threats for people affected by the bushfires, claiming that 
quality of health is compromised for thousands of people.   ""The 
length and density of smoke exposure is a new and possibly fatal health 
risk that many people within our community have not previously had to 
face,"" AMA President Dr Tony Bartone said.   ""With denser smoke 
haze and longer periods that people endure smoke inhalation, there is a 
much higher risk that previously healthy people will face developing 
serious illness.""   Fighting the fires also affects family and gender dynamics, according to Monash University Dr Debra Parkinson.   ""Gendered
 expectations complicate fire plans with men frequently expected to 
defend homes or properties, and women frequently delaying leaving in 
order to persuade her husband or partner to leave with her,"" Dr 
Parkinson said.   This difference on what is expected from men and 
women is believed to add up to the already traumatic experience of 
battling the flames.   ""Disasters like the current bushfires place 
pressure on men to be resilient and stoic protectors, which makes them 
reluctant to seek help,"" Dr Parkinson said.   ""For women in 
bushfire-affected areas, there's an expectation that they will put their

This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can    sign up here    to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.    aAn
 atomic bomba is how one transport minister in Australia described the 
bush fires that continue to ravage the country. Having burned through  an area larger than Switzerland  and  bloodied the sky  as far as New Zealand, the fires have killed at least  25 people  and  hundreds of millions of animals , by some estimates. Hereas how people are making sense of the devastation, whoas to blame and how to help.    Like
 California, Australia is naturally primed to burn. But global warming 
has worsened the problem by turning greenery into kindling. (Average 
highs in Australia hit a record  107.4 degrees Fahrenheit  in December, the start of the Southern Hemisphereas summer, following the driest spring on record.)    This
 year, in what has become athe iconic representation of climate change 
impacts,a undeniable trends and unpredictable weather created aa 
horrific convergence of events,a  according to Chris Field, the director of Stanfordas environmental institute .   As the Times columnist  Paul Krugman has explained ,
 itas not really possible to say whether global warming acauseda a given
 extreme weather event, since weather can have several causes. But  the influence of climate change on extreme weather  in general, from fires to floods, is clear, and  increasingly so.     aThe question that we need to ask is, aHow much worse are we willing to let this get?aa  said
 an Australian National University climate scientist, Nerilie Abram. If 
this is what global warming of just over 1 degree Celsius looks like, 
Ms. Abram says, do we really want to see the impacts of 3 degrees or 
more? Because that, she adds, ais the trajectory we are on.a   One 
of the many heads of state leading the world down that trajectory is 
Australiaas prime minister, Scott Morrison. A member of the right-wing 
Liberal Party,  he has proved hostile  to calls for more robust climate action and pledged to  outlaw forms  of environmental protest.    Australia was  ranked last out of 57 countries  on climate change policy by the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index   (just behind the United States), which singled out Mr. Morrison as a aregressive force.a     Mr. Morrison has also drawn ire  for his handling of this fire season; at one point he left for a vacation in Hawaii.    But in some ways, Mr. Morrison has simply picked up where previous Australian leaders left off,   writes the Australian novelist Richard Flanagan  in The Times: Since 1996, successive conservative governments have  subverted international agreements on climate change .   aIncredibly,a
 Mr. Flanagan writes, athe response of Australiaas leaders to this 
unprecedented national crisis has been not to defend their country but 
to defend the fossil fuel industry, a big donor to both major parties.a    aMorrison is right about one thing a the only solution is global action,a   writes Ross Gittins ,
 the economics editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, Australiaas oldest 
newspaper. While Mr. Morrison certainly deserves blame, Mr. Gittins 
says, nothing Australia could have done by itself would have prevented 
the current devastation, since the country accounts  for only 1.3 percent of global emissions .   aAll
 the big, rich economies a particularly the Americans, less so the 
Europeans a must share the blame for the continuing rise in average 
temperatures,a he writes.   aEven the biggest developing economies a China and India, particularly a could have done more to reduce the  intensity  of their emissions (emissions per dollar of G.D.P.) without abandoning their efforts to raise their living standards.a    aIf
 in the past year (or the past decade) the world began to understand how
 dangerous climate change is, it certainly didnat act like it,a  Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of aThe Sixth Extinction,a  writes in The New Yorker .
 In the past 10 years, she says, more carbon dioxide was emitted than in
 all of human history up to the election of John F. Kennedy.   aReally
 waking up, and not just dreaming to ourselves that things will be O.K.,
 has become urgent a beyond urgent,a she writes. She paraphrases fire 
officials in the Australian state of Victoria: aThe world is in danger, 
and we need to act immediately to survive.a     [Related: aThis apocalyptic Australian summer is our Sandy Hook moment.a]      Cutting carbon emissions is no longer enough ,
 according to David Bowman, a professor of fire science at the 
University of Tasmania. aWe still have to decarbonize but now we also 
have to adapt,a  he writes in The Conversation .   One
 adaptation Australians could make, he suggests, is shifting the 
traditional vacation season a during which schools have their summer 
break a to cooler months, so that families arenat heading into the 
countryas forests and national parks at the peak of fire season.    Rearranging
 the calendar around risk may meet resistance, he writes, but it could 
reduce the strain on firefighters and make mass evacuations easier.    California could learn something from Australiaas fire warning system ,  writes Diana Leonard 
 in The Washington Post. After the disastrous Black Saturday fires of 
2009, which killed 173 people, the country developed a more 
sophisticated, national warning protocol, which the chief executive of 
the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center in 
Melbourne believes has saved lives.    The National Weather Service 
provides something of a similar function for tornadoes and severe 
thunderstorms in the United States, but in California fire evacuation 
orders are issued by local law enforcement, a system that hasnat always 
kept pace with the most extreme blazes. aA more centralized system, like
 the one in Australia, could allow the public to access information 
about the location and spread of a dangerous fire in real time,a Ms. 
Leonard writes.    Australia has an arson problem ,  writes Paul Read 
 in The Australian Financial Review. A senior lecturer at the School of 
Psychological Sciences at Monash University, Mr. Read notes that  as much as 50 percent 
 of Australiaas wildfires are potentially set deliberately. The New 
South Wales Police Force announced on Monday that it had charged  24 people in connection with bush fire arson .   aIf
 we are to prevent bush fires and save lives, property and wildlife, we 
will also need to find solutions for the other more complex human 
dimensions of the causes of conflagrations like the ones we are now 
witnessing,"" he writes.   More than a million people have donated upward of $20 million to  a Facebook fund-raising page  started by the Australian comedian Celeste Barber,  the largest ever  such effort on the platform. The money will reportedly be distributed to the  countryas firefighting services . Another Facebook fund-raising page has raised more than $4 million for  WIRES , Australiaas largest wildlife rescue organization.     aNot all heroes wear capes.a 
 An Instagram model named Kaylen Ward (alias the Naked Philanthropist) 
says she has raised $500,000 by direct messaging her nude photos to 
followers in exchange for proof of a charitable donation,  reports Kim Bellware  in The Washington Post.

said smoke has made its way across the Pacific Ocean, turning the 
sunsets in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires an eerie shade of red.    'The fires have led to hazardous air quality, which has affected human health, in major cities in Australia, spreading to  New Zealand  and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America,' WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis said.   She said smoke had 'probably' reached Antarctica.    Scroll down for video     In

 least 25 people are dead and six million hectares of land have been 
destroyed nationwide - an area similar to size of the Republic of 
Ireland.    On Monday, Canberra's air quality was the worst of 
any major city in the world after winds carried in smoke from bushfires 
in New South Wales.    While milder conditions on Tuesday have 
given emergency crews temporary relief, the weather is set to turn on 
Friday and climate experts believe the hottest and driest days are yet 
to come.   Temperatures could hit the mid-30s on the south coast and soar to into the 40s in other parts of NSW by Friday.

 season usually peaks in February - the hottest and driest month when 
the nation has been hit by the likes of Black Saturday and Ash Wednesday
 - the worst bushfire disasters in national history.   The Bureau of
 Meteorology's (BOM) long-range climate outlook predicted above average 
temperatures and below average rainfall for much of the east through 
until at least the end of March.   Weatherzone meteorologist Tom Hough said: 'Warmer than average and drier than average is the trend that looks to be continuing.   'Based off the climate outlooks it doesn't look like we're going to see any significant rainfall.'   In
 a piece for The Conversation, Monash University emeritus professor 
Neville Nicholls said Australia has already suffered through severe 
heatwaves this summer, but it may get worse.   'They usually peak in the middle and end of summer, so the worst may be yet to come.'   Billions of animals are believed to have perished in the blazes and experts fear some may now be extinct.   As
 the unprecedented crisis worsens with warnings of power brown outs, NSW
 transport minister and MP for the fire-ravaged south coast, Andrew 
Constance, compared the fires to 'an atomic bomb'.   'I've got to be
 honest with you, this isn't a bushfire it's an atomic bomb,' he said, 
as he revealed he had been defending his own home from embers.    Evacuations
 are underway and emergency alerts are in place in NSW, Victoria and 
South Australia as authorities predict the devastating bushfires will 
continue burning until at least March.    At least 28 people have been killed in blazes across the country since the bushfire season began in October.

kangaroos, wallabies, gliders, potoroos, cockatoos and honeyeaters.'    Scroll down for video     Original

damage of national forests and millions of trees, releasing enormous 
volumes of carbon dioxide that are already affecting air quality.   The
 Australian Medical Association has warned of new health threats for 
people affected by the bushfires, claiming that quality of health is 
compromised for thousands of people.   'The length and density of 
smoke exposure is a new and possibly fatal health risk that many people 
within our community have not previously had to face,' AMA President Dr 
Tony Bartone said.   'With denser smoke haze and longer periods that
 people endure smoke inhalation, there is a much higher risk that 
previously healthy people will face developing serious illness.'    The carcass of a Kangaroo is seen after the area was ravaged by bushfires, on Kangaroo Island   Devastating: A dead Koala is seen after bushfires swept through on Kangaroo Island   A kangaroo injured in bushfires has water poured over it   Fighting the fires also affects family and gender dynamics, according to Monash University Dr Debra Parkinson.   'Gendered
 expectations complicate fire plans with men frequently expected to 
defend homes or properties, and women frequently delaying leaving in 
order to persuade her husband or partner to leave with her,' Dr 
Parkinson said.   This difference on what is expected from men and 
women is believed to add up to the already traumatic experience of 
battling the flames.   'Disasters like the current bushfires place 
pressure on men to be resilient and stoic protectors, which makes them 
reluctant to seek help,' Dr Parkinson said.   'For women in 
bushfire-affected areas, there's an expectation that they will put their
 own needs last to support their husbands, partners and families who may
 be traumatised from fighting fires and protecting their homes.   Mental
 health awareness organisation Beyond Blue highlights that traumatic 
reactions in communities an individuals affected by a bushfire are at

1402147569,http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/08/WS5e153594a310cf3e35583232.html,2020-01-08,Australia fires force rethink,"  Australia's plight seen as clear sign climate change cannot be ignored    Residents of bushfire-ravaged Australia have been forced to ask themselves if this is the new normal.   For more than five months, fires have been cutting deadly paths 
across much of the continent. Their sheer size and intensity have been 
on a scale not previously seen in the country.   So far, fires have burned through more than 6 million hectares of 
land, and about 2,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed. Remote 
villages have been obliterated and millions of farm animals have died, 
and an estimated half a billion wild animals have been killed and their 
habitats destroyed.   At least 25 people have died, with many more injured, and the 
emotional and mental toll on those who have survived is immeasurable.   By Monday, the extreme weather conditions had eased, with cooler 
temperatures and rainfall bringing relief to exhausted firefighters in 
some areas. But by Tuesday morning, more than 130 blazes were reported 
across the country.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison is considering calling a Royal 
Commission to look into the fires and the government's response, as 
criticism mounts over his handling of the emergency.   Morrison's response to the fires has been criticized as slow, 
although days ago he made history by mobilizing 3,000 reserve troops. 
However, the decision to release a government video, with a musical 
soundtrack, announcing the government's mobilization of military assets 
was seen by many as tacky.   In addition, the federal government announced on Sunday the setting 
up of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, with more than A$2 billion 
($1.38 billion) for rebuilding infrastructure.   Politician Richard Di Natale, leader of the Australian Greens 
political party, has described the fires as Australia's ""moment of 
truth"".   ""We must accept that Australia's climate has changed, and we need to 
make sure that our land management, disaster response and climate 
policies are relevant to the new reality we face,"" he said in a 
statement.   The impact of the fires is being felt well beyond Australia's 
borders. In New Zealand, around 1,600 kilometers across the Tasman Sea, 
smoke from the fires has turned pristine glaciers brown.   David Holmes, director of the Monash Climate Change Communication 
Research Hub at Melbourne's Monash University, said, ""This isn't just 
about cyclical drought, which politicians like to use to normalize the 
current situation.   ""In the last 15 years, Australia saw eight of its 10 warmest years on
 record. Climate scientists tell us that, with climate change, weather 
systems increasingly move poleward. This means that storm tracks that 
once brought moisture from the Southern Ocean right up the east coast 
are not reaching as far, and inland forested areas are becoming much 
drier,"" he said.   David Bowman, a professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the 
University of Tasmania, said the bushfires provide a ""critical link to 
understanding how climate change will transform bushfire behavior, 
frequency and ecological impacts"".   ""We are now transiting away from what climate models tell us about 
the possible effects of climate change on bushfires, to observing and 
experiencing extreme, unusual and ecologically and economically damaging
 bushfires driven by anomalous climate conditions,"" he said.   This is all new ground, said Bowman. However, he added, ""As a 
society, we are running out of time to adapt to climate changedriven 
bushfires, and policy failure will lead to escalating disasters that 
have the capacity to eclipse the worst disasters we have experienced.""   The Climate Council, in a paper on bushfires and climate, said that 
for more than 20 years scientists have warned that climate change would 
increase the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia.   ""This warning was accurate. Scientists expect extreme fire weather 
will continue to become more frequent and severe without substantial and
 rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" the council paper 
said.   In 2009, Australia's Common-wealth Scientific and Industrial Research
 Organisation warned of the coming dangers of extreme weather conditions
 and their impact on bushfires. In a paper titled ""Climate Change', the 
agency said, ""For Australia, heatwaves, fires, floods and southern 
Australian droughts are all expected to become more frequent and more 
intense in the coming decades.   ""Snow and frost are very likely to become rarer or less intense 
events. Locally and regionally, the greatest impacts will be felt 
through changes in water availability and sea level, and extreme weather
 events,"" the report said.   In March last year, former state fire commissioners warned Prime 
Minister Morrison that the extreme weather conditionsi 1/4 long, hot dry 
periods with little or no rain, and dry winds and prolonged droughti 1/4 will
 bring devastating bushfires on a scale never before seen in the 
country.   Jim McLennan, a bushfire safety researcher and adjunct professor with
 the school of Psychology and Public Health at Melbourne's La Trobe 
University, said climate change is a factor that cannot be ignored, 
given the fires that have swept along Australia's east coast.   ""Average temperatures across the country have risen and our summers are getting hotter,"" he said.   ""During the last two years, annual rainfalls have been well below 
long-term averages. In addition, annual rainfall patterns have changed, 
so that there are longer periods between rain events. This has resulted 
in drought conditions in many parts of Australia.""   The result is that soil moisture levels are low and vegetation is 
dryer, McLennan said. Bushfires are becoming more frequent, and the fire
 season is lasting longer.   The long-term changes in Australia's climate, identified by climate 
scientists as resulting from global warming, mean that ""the intense 
fires we are witnessing will become more frequent, and they are now 
occurring in areas which were previously very low bushfire risk areas,"" 
he said.  "

record, according to the Bureau of Meteorology's Annual Climate 
Statement.   The average mean temperature in 2019 was 1.52 C above average, said 
the bureau's head of climate monitoring, Karl Braganza, at a media 
briefing on Jan 8.   The national average rainfall for the year was 277 millimeters, the lowest on record.   Braganza said that while the debate on climate change continues, 
there is little doubt climate change has ""played a big part"" in the 
disastrous fire season, adding, ""the science is quite clear on that"".   ""We are now seeing clear, well-defined trends in climate change over the past several decades in Australia,"" he said.   ""We are seeing trends in maximum temperature rises, reduced rainfall 
throughout the country, especially in southwest Western Australia and in
 the southeast of the country (New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania).""   Braganza said the mix has contributed to the severe fire weather now being experienced across Australia.   Since the fires began in September in southern Queensland, some six 
million hectares of land has been burned around the country. In the 
state of New South Wales alone, the loss has been four million hectares.   The death toll from the current bushfire season was 26 people by Jan 
8, compared with 173 in Victoria state's Black Saturday fires of 2009. 
Analysts attributed the reduced mortality to the courage of communities 
and firefighters, with the assistance of other states and nations, the 
military, new technologies, and in some cases the policies put in place 
as a result of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission.   Paul Read, a senior research fellow at the Monash Sustainability 
Institute at Monash University and a co-director of the National Centre 
for Research in Bushfire and Arson, said: ""Despite resistance from 
people who become enraged at the very mention of climate or Greta 
Thunberg (the young Swedish climate activist), these fires are 
unprecedented in Australian history and the reasons have all the 
hallmarks of climate change.  "

 a the use of the earthas heat to generate power a is better than 
photovoltaic energy in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, according to 
an analysis by researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)  Hyderabad  and  Monash University , Australia.
   
The researchers also suggest that a combination of  renewable energy 
 technology must be adopted in this era of dwindling fossil fuel 
reserves and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, a press release from 
IIT Hyderabad said.
   
The analysis was undertaken by Prof D Chandrasekharam, Department of 
Civil Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and Prof G Ranjith Pathegama, 
Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, 
Australia.
   
aWhile solar power does have benefits over conventional energy sources, 
is the hype surrounding its apparent agreennessa justified? Solar power 
is far from the zero-emissions energy source that it is claimed to be,a 
said D Chandrasekharam.
   
Their study involved lifecycle assessment of renewables. Around 10 
tonnes of quartz is needed to manufacture solar cells that can generate 1
 megawatt of electricity from Sun. 1 MWe of electricity can support 
about 20,000 people annually.
   
aImagine how many tonnes of quartz has to be mined to support millions 
of people in the countries,a said Chandrasekharam. aA Solar pv cell 
involves two important stages: i) producing metallurgical grade silicon 
(MGS) and ii) producing electronic grade silicon (EGS) from quartz. In 
the first stage an amount of 1756 thousand tonnes of CO2 is released, 
and a similar amount of CO2 is released during the conversion of EGS to 
ingots,a he added. The total CO2 emissions during the lifecycle of a 
solar pv cell are about 3312 million kg. This is far higher than 
geothermal energy source, which emits about 450 g/ kWh generated reports

Turning 78 this February, the Noosa, south Queensland-based 
playwright is about to see his last two new plays produced back to back 
in Sydney where he built his career, while his classic 
semi-autobiographical satire of the harbour metropolis, Emerald City, 
will be remounted in a new production in Brisbane and Melbourne.   Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact he is widely regarded as 
Australiaas most commercially successful playwright, with a loyal 
audience hooked on his naturalistic style of storytelling about the 
white middle class, Williamsonas relationship with the people he sees as
 the cultural gatekeepers a theatre critics a has been fraught. 
Williamson says critics dismiss his work because it is popular, although
 the  quality of his work  has also been questioned. He once accused the Sydney Theatre Company  of ignoring his plays  abecause Iam not theatre with a capital Ta.   Williamson argues his playwrighting has always examined human 
psychology and verbal self-deception. But he now says he wants to make 
way for younger voices, including the minority playwrights he 
acknowledges have been denied a platform, to tackle the many issues 
Australia is facing. Heas had a adream runa, he emphasises, and acanat 
whingea about his unabated box office success.   For Williamson, who has five children and 14 grandchildren, 
retirement is also motivated by his health: he has a long-term heart 
rhythm problem and several years ago suffered a  transient ischaemic attack ,
 which temporarily paralysed the right side of his body. aThe whole 
process is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole 
business of opening nights,a he says. aFor many years, I couldnat even 
go to an opening night. I had to have Kristin [Williamson, his wife and a
 fellow writer] reporting to me how things were going.   aYou go to a brilliant opening night, you know it has connected, and 
then you think [of the critics]: aOh those fuckersa. I remember one 
[review] line that said, aI sat with a dark cloud hovering above me as 
people fell off their seats laughing around mea. And you think, what is 
so terrible about that? Why did the black cloud descend upon him to see 
people enjoying themselves in the theatre?a   Famously, Williamsonas writing has often been clearly drawn from his 
experiences. In the early 1970s, he left his then-pregnant wife for his 
current wife, who also left her husband. This became the basis for his 
early play Jugglers Three, a depiction of two marriages breaking up, 
rewritten many years later as Third World Blues in which a character 
called Elizabeth accuses a character called Neville, based on 
Williamson, of having a ahyperinflated egoa.   Is everything in his life playwriting material? aWell, I have drawn 
on life. Any writer who says they donat is lying. But you do change and 
alter [the details].a   In her 2009 biography of Williamson, Kristin a who met the playwright
 when she was cast in one of his early plays a argued that the aoutraged
 letters and emailsa her husband afired off in fits of ragea to critics,
 directors and producers were borne of a sensitivity that also made him 
an aastute dramatista who could perceive amalignant undercurrents in 
social behavioura.   We meet in the rehearsal room for his  new play Family Values .
 Williamson stands more than two metres tall; he used to fantasise about
 being shorter so he wouldnat stand out so much. He is affable, sincere,
 a good listener, eloquent and forthcoming in his responses, although he
 brings up the critics of his work much earlier than I had planned: itas
 clearly a spectre that will always bother him, even while acknowledging
 he has overreacted on occasion.   He agrees with his wifeas take on his psychology a but adds the 
rhythms of the abitter fightinga between his late parents, gregarious 
retail saleswoman mother Elvie and quiet accountant father Keith, also 
aenormouslya influenced his work.   aI didnat realise it at the time, but my brother and I grew up in a 
house of perpetual drama,a he says. aThere was hardly a minute when they
 werenat having a go at each other. It wasnat until the age of 11 that I
 realised it was a bit more complex than that, when I caught my mother 
goading my father to the point of an explosion.   aHe was never a physically violent man, but finally he could be 
provoked into calling her names. I remember when my mother raced out to 
the laundry, and I followed her: she was chuckling away.a A few years 
before her death, Williamson brought up the memory, and asked her what 
was going on. aWell, it did get pretty boring in the country,a she 
answered.   aShe was sparking the drama,a he says now. aI spent my young life 
wondering, aHow can I avoid this? Is this what marriage means?aa   Born in 1942, Williamson grew up in the middle-class suburb of 
Bentleigh, then on Melbourneas outskirts. The family moved when he was 
12 to country Bairnsdale.   At the time, theatres in Australia offered virtually no plays about 
contemporary Australian society. In 1964, Williamson became Monash 
Universityas first graduate in mechanical engineering a but as an 
assistant project engineer at General Motors-Holden he would read 
Chekhov under the desk.   Williamsonas subsequent study of psychology at Melbourne University 
would inspire him to think of himself as a asocial scientista, and he 
began writing plays. In 1971, his middle-class suburban election night 
satire, Donas Party, was a hit at the Pram Factory, but the collective 
that ran  La Mama theatre 
 in Carlton thought it too bourgeoisie a so he wrote them a hard-hitting
 look at police and male brutality, The Removalists, which won him a 
prestigious award in London.   Instead of moving his career there in the wake of this international 
attention, he sensed his continued connection to Australian place and 
vernacular was critical to his writing. Williamson stayed home and rode 
the 1970s Australian anew wavea film industry resurgence, adapting many 
of his stage plays into successfully produced screenplays.   In his youth, Kristin Williamson wrote, David abecame a zealous 
leftwinger, to the extent that he tried to convert his parentsa. Is he 
still politically to the left? aOh yes,a he says now. aDespite what some
 of my critics have said about me being a social conservative, there is 
an underlying social concern in all but a few of my plays. I always hope
 to be entertaining on the surface, but saying something about the state
 of our society in the subtext.   aI havenat lost that. I am so angered by the growing injustices and 
inequalities in the world that it does still fire me up. Itas almost 
painful to pick up the Murdoch press every day and see the blatant 
attack on social progressivism of any kind, the fervent belief in 
neoliberalism, despite the world heading towards a real catastrophe.   aThe honchos tend to be ageing white males, wealthy white males, who 
are incredibly threatened by the science of climate change, because it 
threatens their whole world view that neoliberalism has delivered huge 
prosperity to the world, that growth can go on forever, that there will 
be no evil consequences.a   Indeed, Williamsonas final two new plays offer social critiques of 
Australia now. Family Values reflects the writeras disdain for 
Australiaas refugee policy, and has an asylum seeker character. 
Mandatory offshore detention ahas been one of the morally despicable 
acts the Australian government has carried out, and both sides are 
guilty a Labor started ita, he says. aI fail to understand  Jacqui Lambie voting against medevac  because she said openly medevac is no threat to Australian security.a   The other play,  Crunch Time 
 a a blackly comic story of a father and son healing a relationship a 
carries the theme of assisted death. Williamson laments the failure of 
most states to adopt voluntary euthanasia laws. aThe NSW Liberal party 
seems to be still in thrall of the religious right, and itas the lizard 
brain dictating the rational capacity of human beings; itas some 
emotional fear that someone is going to turn the switch off on them, or 
God wants to prolong our pain as long as possible before we have a 
decent death,a he says.   Would Williamson want voluntary euthanasia for himself, if it came to
 that? aAbsolutely. I saw a friend die recently of pancreatic cancer, 
and they fade away to a human skeleton. Itas a horrible way to leave an 
image for your loved ones.   aIad rather go out when they still recognise me as me, so thereas a 
bit of vanity, but also Iad want to avoid the extreme pain of the end 
game.a     aC/  Family Values runs at  SBW Stables  at Griffin Theatre in Sydney from 17 January until 7 March. Crunch Time runs at  Ensemble Theatre  in Sydney from 14 February until 9 April. Emerald City runs in Brisbane at  QPAC Playhouse  from 8-29 February, and in Melbourne at  Southbank Theatre, The Sumner  from 6 March to 18 April.   "

 are parts of Australia where itas currently a health risk to step 
outside and breathe. One is the nationas capital, which last week 
boasted  the most heavily polluted air in the world .
 At 1 a.m. on New Yearas Day, an air monitoring site in Canberra 
recorded levels of pollution more than 25 times higher than what's 
considered ahazardous.a   Two weeks earlier, the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) issued  a joint statement 
 declaring that the poor air quality throughout the state of New South 
Wales constituted a public health emergency. aThere is no safe level of 
air pollution,a the statement cautioned. aThe higher the level of 
pollution, the more hazardous the risks to health. Bushfire smoke is 
particularly hazardous because of the high levels of tiny particles.a   Now,
 as hundreds of thousands of acres burn throughout the country, people 
around Australia are passively inhaling some of the least breathable air
 on the planet; it's more heavily polluted than that of Shanghai, 
Beijing, Mumbai, or Delhi. Clouds of smoke are traveling hundreds of 
miles, enveloping the nationas major cities and drifting as far as New 
Zealand. The public health emergency continues to escalate. And 
according to Dr. Yuming Guo, head of Monash Universityas Climate and Air
 Quality Research (CARE) unit, such toxic air could easily become the 
silent killer of Australiaas climate catastrophe.   Image by Wendell Teodoro (ZEDUCE/AFP)   aAny amount of pollution is badabut the air quality in Australia at the moment is   really 
 bad,a he told VICE over the phone. aIn the short-term, this kind of 
pollution could increase the risk of death, hospital admissions, 
emergency department visits, and ambulance calls. In the long-term it 
might be associated with shortened life expectancy and the development 
of diseasesarespiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
dementiaaas well as mental health problems, and adverse birth outcomes.a   When
 Dr. Guo says ashort-terma he means the days and weeks during which the 
pollution is directly experienced; when he says along-terma heas talking
 about months or years down the line. Pollutants can kill people fast 
and slow. And further exacerbating these health risks is the fact that 
Australia has, until now, enjoyed a history of clean air.    Dr. 
Guo explained that while usually the aair quality here is very good,a 
this ultimately means the Australian people are more vulnerable to air 
pollution because they havenat physically adapted to be able to cope 
with it. aTheyare more likely to see those health impacts,a as he puts 
it. aAnd the air in Australia got very bad very fastaso thatas also a 
problem.a   Children and the elderly face a particularly serious 
risk because their bodies are even less well-adapted, while people with 
asthma are far more susceptible to suffering the adverse respiratory 
effects of smoke inhalation. Experts have warned, however, that even 
relatively healthy people are at risk of developing serious illnesses 
from prolonged exposure to air pollution.    Tony Bartone, 
president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), described the 
length and density of smoke exposure in Australia at the moment as aa 
new and possibly fatal health risk that many people within our community
 have not previously had to face.a   ""With denser smoke haze and 
longer periods that people endure smoke inhalation, there is a much 
higher risk that previously healthy people will face developing serious 
illness,"" he said in a  statement , and went on to note that athe mental health burden of this disaster on our communities will be considerable.a   Recent
 studies have drawn similar connections between air pollution and mental
 health outcomes, with at least one research paper  linking poor air quality to an increased risk of depression and suicide .
 In that study, a team of researchers from University College London 
(UCL) and Kingas College London found that long-term exposure to fine 
particulate matterathat is, tiny particles of dust and sootawas linked 
to depression and anxiety. They also found that short-term exposure to 
coarse particulate matterasuch as those found in dust and smokeaappears 
to influence the risk of suicide.   ""Our findings correspond with 
other studies that have come out this year, with further evidence in 
young people and in other mental health conditions,a said senior author 
Dr. Joseph Hayes in a  statement .
 aWhile we cannot yet say that this relationship is causal, the evidence
 is highly suggestive that air pollution itself increases the risk of 
adverse mental health outcomes.""   Dr. Guo echoed these warnings, 
pointing to a study that looked at the health impacts of the 2014 
Hazelwood fireaa blaze in a Victorian coal mine that burned for weeks, 
blanketing surrounding communities in smoke. Findings suggested that 
apeople exposed to smoke during the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire were still 
experiencing psychological distress and respiratory symptoms two and a 
half years later.a Dr. Guo stressed, however, that aeveryone in the 
country should be prepared [for the current bushfire season].a   There
 are those who are already taking precautionary measures by wearing face
 masks and staying indoors. Dr. Guo endorsed these methods of harm 
reduction, but insisted that the masks need to be high qualityaan N95 or
 P2 arespiratora mask that filters out at least 95 percent of tiny 
particlesaand people need to check their houses for air leaks. He 
further advised that people use high quality air conditioners with 
filters or standalone air purifiers if possible, and avoid exercising 
either indoors or outdoors. Those who start seeing adverse health 
effects should seek out the relevant medicine. Above all else, though, 
Dr. Guo advises staying out of the polluted air whenever possible.   aPeople
 shouldnat go outside at all in places like Canberra or the badly 
affected communities, but if necessary they should only go outside for a
 short distanceato buy food, for example,a he said. aThere are fires in 
all parts of the country, so air pollution is everywhere. Itas going to 
be a real problem.a     Follow Gavin Butler on    Twitter    or    Instagram .   "

turned the sun red, the moon orange and the sky an insipid grey. It has 
obscured iconic views tourists flock to see. Far more than an aesthetic 
problem, it has forced business shutdowns, triggered health problems and
 kept children indoors for weeks.   City dwellers in south-east Australia have been forced to take a 
crash course in the finer points of air pollution. Weave learned about 
the dangers of inhaling tiny PM2.5 particles (those 2.5 microns or fewer
 in diameter). Weave learned that only a  close-fitting P2 mask  will do much to protect us.   Still, we wear disposable paper masks and hold handkerchiefs to our faces, hoping any amount of filtering is helpful.   Even for an historian of air pollution like me, this situation is a 
shock. It is not the first time Australiaas major cities have been 
shrouded in bushfire smoke. But the terrible air quality is unmatched in
 terms of severity, duration and extent.   Historically, air pollution from smoke was considered outside human 
control and not subject to regulation. But these bushfires are  clearly linked to global warming , for which government, corporations and individuals are responsible. Itas time to rethink the way we protect air quality.   In recent weeks, apps such as  AirVisual 
 have confirmed what we city dwellers can already see and smell: since 
the fires on the north coast of New South Wales began in late October, 
our air quality has plummeted.   The NSW governmentas  Air Quality Index 
 data has shown that since late October, days when the index was higher 
than 100 a signalling exposure is unhealthy a have outnumbered clear 
days in Sydney, Newcastle and the Illawarra.   Index readings above 2,550 have been recorded in Sydney, while the  Monash monitoring site  in Canberra reached a choking 5,185 at 8pm on New Yearas Day.   Bushfire smoke has affected the cities of NSW and the Australian Capital Territory in the past.  In late January 1926 ,
 when Canberra was just emerging as a city, a thick haze of smoke sat 
over the site. Fires came within metres of Yarralumla, the residence 
which, the following year, would become home to the governor general.   In several years in the mid-1930s, bushfires burning to the north of Sydney left the city air thick with smoke.  In October 1936 , bushfire smoke forced a motor liner arriving from Hong Kong to  warily enter the harbour  sounding its siren, because it was invisible to signallers on South Head.   A New Zealand pilot, flying into Sydney from Longreach the following month, had to  fly blind 
 in agreat clouds of dense smokea covering much of NSW. In 1939, 
Canberra was covered by what the visiting writer HG Wells described as a
  astreaming smoke curtaina .   In the summer of 1944, Sydney was again enveloped in a smoke haze, 
this time from fires in the Blue Mountains and (later Royal) national 
park in November. Photographs published at the time show the  Sydney Harbour Bridge 
 barely visible through dust and smoke at midday. The ongoing fires were
 blamed for an increase in diseases of the ears, nose and throat, and 
for cases of influenza and pneumonia, leading to a shortage of hospital 
beds.   In November 1951, all of NSW was said to be blacked out by bushfire smoke. In Sydney on the worst days, records show  all four of the cityas airfields  were closed because of asmoke-foga.   In each of these episodes, bushfire smoke disrupted transport, 
commerce, health and the enjoyment of the urban environment. But even as
 other forms of air pollution began to be regulated, smoke from 
bushfires escaped legislative attention.   What was understood as air pollution were the unwanted byproducts of 
industrial processes, whereas bushfire smoke was viewed as natural.    In NSW in 1866 ,
 an act based on British legislation restricted smoke from mills, 
distilleries and gas works. Further limitations on smoke production in 
built-up areas were included in later acts governing public health 
(1902), motor traffic (1909) and local government (1919).   After the second world war  Newcastle ,
 the site of the countryas largest concentration of coal-burning heavy 
industry, began to pay closer attention to managing air quality. This 
pioneering work was given added urgency after  4,000 people died  in heavy London smog in 1952.   In 1958, a NSW parliamentary committee delivered a  report 
 into smoke abatement. It did not mention recent issues with bushfire 
smoke, and also dismissed the impact of domestically produced smoke. The
 subsequent  1961 Clean Air Act  focused on air pollution from industry, transport and power generation.   Air pollution legislation continued to  evolve in following decades ,
 targeting motor vehicle emissions in the 1970s, backyard burning of 
waste in the 1980s, and wood fires used to heat homes in the 1990s.   These measures have been successful. A  2006 study 
 found that between 1998 and 2003, on the limited occasions when 
standards for PM10 in six Australian cities were exceeded, the main 
sources were not industry or transport, but dust storms and bushfires 
(with the exception of Launceston, where heating fires were the main 
contributor).   Today, bushfire smoke is excluded from air quality regulations, 
despite its obvious role in pollution. It is still considered natural 
and beyond human control.   However, the  link between the current fires and human-caused climate change , long predicted by climate scientists, suggests this exemption is no longer valid.   As the Australian National Universityas  Tom Griffiths 
 has written, the current fires in some ways repeat patterns of the 
past. But athe smoke is worse, more widespread and more enduringa.   When Australia begins the recovery from these fires, our 
business-as-usual approach requires a rethink. Measures to protect air 
quality should be a major part of this.   It is time that corporations, governments and societies which 
contribute to global heating be held to account for more frequent, 
intense and widespread bushfires, and the smoke which billows from them.   Nancy Cushing is an associate professor at the University of Newcastle   This piece was originally published  in the Conversation   "

The  European Union  is trying to stop Australian winemakers using the term because they say Prosecco is only produced in northern  Italy .   But
 the federal government has thrown money at university researchers in an
 effort to keep Australian winemakers in competition with their European
 counterparts.    Until 2009 the word Prosecco was used to describe wine produced from a certain type of grape (stock image)    Previously,
 the government gave $100,000 to Melbourne's Monash University to 
investigate the legality of restricting the term based on geography.   Until 2009 the word Prosecco was used to describe wine produced from a certain type of grape.   But
 the EU is fighting to have this changed, instead establishing the word 
'Prosecco' to describe a type of wine made in Northern Italy.   Australia's Prosecco exports are worth $60 million annually and are predicted to rise to $500 million over the next decade.   In
 making the funding announcement Federal Minister for Education Dan 
Tehan was scathing of the legitimacy of the claims by the European 
Union.   'Our research into geographic indications for wine will 
ensure local wine makers aren't disadvantaged by foreign producers 
making spurious claims for the exclusive use of wine names, such as 
prosecco,' Minister Tehan said.   STOCK: The EU is fighting 
to change legal rights for the word Prosecco, trying to limit the word's
 use to describe a type of wine made in Northern Italy   One 
of the main producers for the sparkling drink in Australia are the 
Victorian-based 'Brown Brothers', who have enjoyed a 50 per cent growth 
in Prosecco sales year-on-year.   The company Director described the initiative as 'sneaky' when the announcement was first made.   He
 also suggested the war over naming rights was driven by commercial 
convenience due to a rise in popularity of the drink over the past 
decade.   STOCK: Australia's Prosecco exports are worth $60 
million annually and are predicted to rise to $500 million over the next
 decade   The fight over naming rights started 12 months ago 
as part of a push by the European Union to establish new trade deals 
with Italy and Greece.   Along with Prosecco, the EU wants to retain exclusive naming rights for feta, parmesan and mozzarella.   A
 likely compromise would see products still labelled by the country of 
origin of their ingredients, such as 'Australian prosecco' or 
'Australian feta'.     Advertisement    "
1409499285,https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/01/14/20/will-bushfires-affect-australian-open-tennis,2020-01-14,Will bushfires affect Australian Open tennis?," MELBOURNE -- The Australian Open tennis Grand Slam starts next week 
in the midst of a bushfire crisis that has left at least 27 people dead 
and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.   Toxic air pollution clouded Melbourne on Tuesday, halting practice sessions and slightly delaying qualifying.   AFP Sport looks at the implications for players and fans at the first
 Major tennis tournament of the year, which starts on Monday:    - What are the dangers? -    Air pollution could pose health problems for players, fans and 
officials, especially in the high temperatures of the Australian 
summer.    Until Tuesday, Melbourne hadn't been as badly affected as Canberra or Sydney, but conditions deteriorated suddenly.   Air pollution shot up to ""hazardous"" levels, city authorities said, telling residents to stay indoors and keep pets inside.   Australian Open practice was suspended and qualifying delayed. 
Slovenian qualifier Dalila Jakupovic had to retire from her match after 
suffering a coughing fit, although it wasn't clear if pollution was to 
blame.   However, Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley has said he expects the tournament to go ahead as scheduled.    ""We don't expect any delays and we've implemented additional measures
 to ensure the Australian Open will be able to run as scheduled,"" Tiley 
said last week.    - How bad can it get? -    Fires are still burning in Victoria, where Melbourne is the state 
capital, and could continue throughout the tournament, with huge blazes 
to the city's east.    ""It is going to depend on the prevailing winds and whether we have 
ongoing fires,"" Christine Jenkins, professor of respiratory medicine at 
the University of New South Wales in Sydney, told AFP.    ""It's still an open question just whether or not we could still have further periods of intense pollution.""    On Tuesday, air quality monitors recorded pollution at 20 times greater than safe levels in some parts of Melbourne.   ""There is very definitely the threat of fire that could cause significant air pollution in Melbourne,"" Jenkins said.    - What are the health risks? -    Players who are recovering from respiratory tract infections are particularly at risk, as well as those with asthma.    Pollution can irritate the respiratory tract, intensifying and 
prolonging symptoms -- but the health dangers don't stop there.    ""It (pollution) increases the risks of respiratory symptoms, 
cardiovascular disorder, eye symptoms, or mental disorders,"" warned 
Professor Yuming Guo, head of the Climate, Air Quality Research Unit at 
the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University
 in Melbourne.    ""All these would influence of the performance of the players.""     - What's being done for players? -    Meteorological and air quality experts will be on site to monitor 
conditions. Any smoke hazards will be treated in a similar way to 
extreme heat and rain, with umpires able to stop play if air monitoring 
shows it is too dangerous to continue.    Melbourne Park, the venue for the Australian Open, has three roofed 
stadiums and eight other indoor courts. While facemasks are impractical 
for players, Jenkins advised them to stay hydrated and get plenty of 
rest.   ""Staying well hydrated keeps the respiratory membranes well moistened and less prone to irritative symptoms,"" she said.    ""Avoiding alcohol, getting plenty of rest, sleeping normal hours and 
not being outdoors any more than you need to be. Difficult for players, 
because they're on practice courts and they're constantly trying to keep
 their (practice) hours up.""    - Have the fires affected other events? -    Last month's SOLAS Big Boat Challenge in Sydney was cancelled after 
thick smoke from bushfires sent visibility plunging on Sydney Harbour. A
 Big Bash cricket match in Canberra was also scrapped because of poor 
air quality and visibility.    At the Australian Open golf tournament in Sydney last month, players 
complained of stinging eyes. and 2015 champion Matt Jones said 
conditions were some of the worse he had ever encountered. In November, 
Rally Australia, the last leg of the FIA World Rally Championship, was 
cancelled.   But most sports fixtures have gone ahead. Australia played cricket 
Test matches against New Zealand in Melbourne and Sydney. And the 10-day
 the ATP Cup tennis tournament has proceeded in Sydney, Brisbane and 
Perth without serious problems.     - Could the Australian Open be cancelled? -    Unlikely. Even if air pollution remains high, organisers would be 
reluctant to axe what is perhaps Australia's biggest sports event of the
 year, and one of only four Grand Slam tournaments on the tennis 
calendar.   According to The Australian newspaper, they will be well covered if 
they do: an insurance policy will provide a hefty pay-out stretching 
into nine figures in the event of a cancellation due to extreme weather.   However, at least one health expert would support delaying or axing the tournament altogether if air quality remains low.   ""If the air pollution is still serious, it would be better to postpone or cancel it,"" said Guo.   ""People when playing or exercising are more affected by air 
pollution, because they inhale deeply forcing air into their lower 
respiratory system where air pollutants accumulate with prolonged 
exposure.""    A(c) Agence France-Presse     For more sports coverage, visit the  ABS-CBN Sports website.

1409967289,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/14/its-climate-change-not-greens-standing-in-the-way-of-fuel-reduction-burns,2020-01-14,"It's climate change, not 'greens' standing in the way of fuel reduction burns | John Thwaites","   I  n April 2005, a fire burnt much of 
Victoriaas beloved national park at Wilsons Promontory leading to the 
evacuation of holidaymakers from Tidal River. The fire was the result of
 a fuel reduction burn, which escaped 10 days after it was lit when the 
weather became hot and windy. I remember it well as I was Victoriaas 
environment minister at the time, responsible for the park and the burn.   The then premier Steve Bracks was one of the campers evacuated.   In 2015 a fuel reduction burn at Lancefield in  Victoria 
 escaped, causing a fire that destroyed six homes and caused a great 
deal of anguish for the local community. There have been many such 
instances of fuel reduction burns escaping and causing damage in 
different parts of Australia. The risk of putting fire in the landscape 
for fuel reduction is real.   For years, elements of the media have promoted the idea that 
agreeniesa and environmentalists have prevented fuel reduction burning. 
This particularly suits those with an agenda to deny climate change as 
it simultaneously advances the culture war against environmentalists and
 draws attention away from the need to take action on climate change. As
 environment minister, I donat recall ever being influenced or lobbied 
by environmentalists or agreensa to stop fuel reduction burns.   What does stand in the way of planned burns is climate change: higher
 temperatures, dryer fuel and strong winds in autumn and spring making 
it unsafe to burn. A shorter timeframe for safe burning a not adebate by
 environmentalistsa a is the overwhelming factor.   Much attention has been given to the recommendation of the Victorian  Bushfires 
 Royal Commission to implement a program of planned burning based on an 
annual target of 5% of public land a 390,000 hectares for Victoria. The 
former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett and others have criticised the 
Victorian government for not achieving this target.   However, these criticisms not only ignore the climate-related 
difficulties with planned burning, they also fail to take account of the
 expert advice received in the years since the royal commission 
reported.   The weather-related difficulties in achieving a hectare-based target 
were born out in 2014, the last year of the Napthine Coalition 
government, when only 82,022 hectares were burnt despite the 
governmentas commitment to the 5% target. Kennettas government itself 
could manage only 40,000 hectares of planned burning in 1997-98 and I 
had the same experience myself when I was minister in the very dry and 
hot 2006 year.   The royal commission itself acknowledged that planned burning is 
risky and only available in limited timeframes. The royal commission 
also recommended that the Victorian government appoint an independent 
person to monitor the implementation of its recommendations. The former 
police chief commissioner Neil Comrie was appointed to the role and in 
his reports in 2012 and 2013 recommended that the planned burning target
 of 5% be replaced. Comrie concluded that the 5% was not aachievable, 
affordable or sustainablea and recommended that it be replaced by a 
risk-based approach with a primary focus on human life and safety.   Following Comrieas reports, the Inspector General of Emergency 
Management recommended a change from a hectare-based target for planned 
burns to a risk reduction target. A group of fire experts from around 
the country reviewed this recommendation and backed the changed approach
 because it focuses on the areas of highest risk rather than on burning 
broad acres for the sake of meeting a target. The risk-based approach 
also creates incentives to pursue alternative forms of risk reduction 
such as mowing and slashing when planned burning is not possible.   In 2016, the Victorian government agreed to adopt this new approach, 
which means that fuel reduction is now done in a way to maximise the 
reduction in risk to people and their homes rather than simply burning 
as many hectares as possible. Fuel reduction burns are now carefully 
planned using computer-based fire models that indicate where the burning
 is likely to be most effective. The target is to reduce the risk that 
homes will be lost by 30%, which experts advised is the right level 
across the state.   Planned burns cannot guarantee that homes will be saved. They are 
most effective when the fire is at ground level, but they are of limited
 effect on the most dangerous fire weather days when a fire can race 
across tree crowns or across already burnt areas.   Fuel reduction burns should be part of the toolkit that our 
firefighting agencies have to tackle the ever-growing risk of bushfire. 
They should not be used as a weapon in the culture wars in order to 
divert attention from the need to act on climate change.   John Thwaites is the chair of Monash Sustainable Development

Callum Mortonas avery confrontinga public artwork offers that peculiar pleasure    Whatas inside Donald Trumpas head?   In a sculptural depiction of the US presidentas head by the Australian artist  Callum Morton , which popped up in Ballarat on Wednesday, not much.   Instead, the piece of public art a three metres high, made from 
fibreglass, resin and timber a is an empty space that viewers of the 
work can climb in and inhabit for themselves.   A combination of sculpture and architecture, the outdoor work a 
titled Monument #32: Helter Shelter a emerges from the ground, and 
contains a shelter fitted with bench seating, and decorated by inferno 
flames.   Since it debuted at the Barangaroo precinct in Sydney, itas been 
popular on Instagram and has travelled to Queensland. On Wednesday it 
debuted in Victoria, at Alfred Deakin Place behind the  Art  Gallery of Ballarat.   Morton, a professor of art at Monash University who has been 
exhibited at Australiaas major art institutions and around the world, 
made Monument #32 in response to our current political times. aI am 
interested a actually I am appalled a by these hard-right, alt-right 
figures,a he told Guardian Australia. aI am aware that this is an ugly 
work, it is a vulgar work a a bit like him. The work is very 
confronting.a Friends of Mortonas have threatened to tip it into Sydney 
Harbour, he said.   Morton spoke to the Guardian while driving through bushfire smoke 
haze on his way to Ballarat for the workas opening event. a[The piece 
is] now going out in the context of the fires. The country is on fire. 
This figure [Trump] can create these circumstances via climate change 
denialism. We are in a time where we need to look at the world. Weare 
living in the smoke haze.a   But what if you are a fan of  Donald Trump ? Could the work be seen in a positive light?   aPeople who like Donald Trump are crazy,a he says bluntly. aI 
understand people who are attracted to the alt-right a it gives people a
 focus. [Alt-right figures] draw on imperial nostalgia to reassure 
people.a   Morton puts Morrisson in the same camp. aI donat think you can find 
hope in politics any more a itas a mockery of representation.a   But while his outlook is grim, the work itself is colourful and cartoonish.   aIave always been drawn to The Simpsons, to saturated colour and 
hyper graphic work. I want to make beautiful things a beautiful things 
are reassuring. Sometimes I do works of beauty a and sometimes I do work
 like this.a   While Morton says he didnat intend to make an image that would spread
 fast on social media, aany work that is kind of readable in the public 
sphere in a pop veneer is an Instagrammable worka.   He says it abelongs to the language of the protest marcha, comparing 
it to paper mache puppets of politicians that appear at rallies. 
Ultimately though, aI donat dictate how people read the work. Everyone 
will bring their own thing to it.a     aC/  Monument #32: Helter Shelter is showing at the Art Gallery of Ballarat until 5 April   "

high-rise buildings across downtown Sydney and Melbourne as dense smoke 
from distant wildfires confuse electronic sensors. Modern government 
office blocks in the Australian capital Canberra have been closed 
because the air inside is too dangerous for civil servants to breathe.    The sun has glowed an eerie red behind a brown shrouded sky for weeks
 over Australian metropolitan areas that usually rank high in the 
worldas most livable cities indexes.    Itas an unprecedented dilemma for Australians accustomed to blue 
skies and sunny days that has raised fears for the long-term health 
consequences if prolonged exposure to choking smoke becomes the new 
summer norm. Similar concerns over smoke are emerging in other regions 
of the globe being impacted by more fires tied to climate change, 
including the Western U.S.   aIam going to give birth any day now, literally, and Iam going to 
have a newborn baby that Iam going to protect from all this,a said Emma 
Mauch, a pregnant Canberra mother.    Her friend, Sonia Connor, described the struggle of keeping her own 
energetic 3-year-old daughter contained inside their Canberra house with
 windows and doors sealed by tape as the outside temperature exceeded 42
 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit). Itas a choice between air 
flow in stifling heat or keeping potentially toxic smoke out.   aMy daughter hasnat shown any sort of symptoms, letas say. For me, I 
can feel it in my lungs, my throat has felt weird,a Connor said.   aIt doesnat seem to be stopping her, but the long-term effects? Who 
knows? Sheas 3. Who knows whatas going to happen?a she added.   Slovenian tennis player Dalila Jakupovic fell to her knees in a 
coughing fit on Wednesday while competing in a qualifying match for the 
Australian Open in Melbourne.   aIave never experienced something like this,a Jakupovic told Australian Broadcasting Corp.   aWe are used to pollution a like, we play in China and more polluted 
countries a but this smoke is something different that for sure weare 
not used to.a    Canberra as well as Australiaas two largest cities, Sydney and 
Melbourne, have at various times in recent weeks rated as the most 
polluted cities in the world, although some argue the industrial 
pollutants in places such as New Delhi are more dangerous than wood 
smoke.   The fires have claimed at least 27 lives since September, destroyed 
more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 
million acres), mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is 
larger than the U.S. state of Indiana.   Hospital admissions have increased in the smoke-affected cities, with
 some patients suffering asthma for the first time in their lives. The 
government has responded by distributing 3.5 million free 
particle-excluding masks.   Acting Australian Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said he was 
discussing with the government launching a study of the long-term health
 implications of the wildfire smoke.   Bruce Thompson, president of the Thoracic Society of Australia and 
New Zealand, is among the respiratory disease experts who predict 
increases in heart and lung diseases as well as some cancers if climate 
change makes prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke an annual phenomenon.   aWeare breathing in stuff that the lungs donat like that leads to 
significant changes, especially people who are predisposed to 
respiratory conditions,a Thompson said.   Thompson, who suffers itchy eyes and a running nose from smoke at 
home in Melbourne, said comparisons could be drawn between the current 
crisis and a wildfire that ignited coal in the open-cut Hazelwood mine 
near the town of Morwell in Victoria state in 2014. The fire burned for 
45 days, blanketing Morwell and its 14,000 residents in thick smoke and 
coal dust.   That exposure was still taking tolls on the health of the Morwell 
community and the wider Latrobe Valley, particularly the young, Thompson
 said.   Brian Oliver, head of the Respiratory Molecular Pathogenesis at 
University of Technology Sydney, likened prolonged and repeated exposure
 to such wildfire smoke to smoking cigarettes.    Oliver predicted increases in smoker diseases across Australia if the
 wildfire smoke became more common in a drier and hotter future.   NASA says the unprecedented masses of Australian smoke that have 
drifted east across the Pacific Ocean have returned after 
circumnavigating the globe.   In the U.S., an estimated 20,000 premature deaths now occur annually 
due to chronic wildfire smoke exposure. Thatas expected to double by the
 end of the century, according to scientists funded by NASA, as tens of 
millions of people get exposed to massive asmoke wavesa emanating from 
blazes in Western states.   Experts say an increase in serious health problems in California may 
be almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become 
more commonplace.   Research suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk.   Short-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and 
lung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, 
studies have shown. Increases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for
 respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy 
people also have been found during and after wildfires.   Some studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks
 and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days 
during previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential 
risks from urban air pollution.   For most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an 
annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort 
that all disappear when the smoke clears.   Wood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air 
pollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner 
than a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially 
causing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, 
research on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart 
attacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.   Whether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is 
uncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be 
tricky. There is little known about the long-term effects of wildfire 
smoke because of difficulties in studying populations years after a 
wildfire.   Michael Abramson, professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine 
at Melbourneas Monash University, is a co-author of a report on the 
ongoing investigation of the health impacts of the Hazelwood blaze.   Abramson urges a national study of the health impacts of the latest 
wildfires, saying his research focused on a much smaller population of 
74,000 people in the Latrobe Valley.   aWeare now seeing substantial exposure extending over weeks to cities
 that have millions of inhabitants, so I think itas very likely that 
there might be more subtle effects that we havenat been able to detect,a
 Abramson said.  "

from wildfires sweeping the nation disrupts the Australian Open tennis 
tournament.   Practice for the first Grand Slam of 2020 was 
suspended Wednesday and qualification for the tournament was delayed 
over air quality concerns. Further decisions on play will be made using 
on-site data, in collaboration with the tournamentas medical team, the 
Bureau of Meteorology and Victoria stateas environmental protection 
agency.   The onsite data and measurements early this morning were similar to yesterday, when  #AusOpen 
 practice and play were suspended and delayed. Conditions yesterday were
 forecast to improve throughout the day, which is what occurred.   Air quality in pockets of host-city Melbourne ranked 
worse than New Delhi and Shanghai on Wednesday, according to the World 
Air Quality Index. In similar conditions Tuesday, Sloveniaas Dalila 
JakupoviA retired from her match after collapsing to her knees in a 
coughing fit and Australiaas Bernard Tomic sought medical treatment when
 he struggled to breath.   The Australian Open ashould be postponed until the air quality is good,a   Yuming Guao ,
 head of the Monash Climate, Air Quality Research (CARE) Unit at Monash 
University said by phone. Playing in such conditions increases blood 
pressure, reduces lung function and can sometimes lead to death, he 
said.   Tennis Australia, the organizers of the event, didnat immediately respond to a request for comment.   The
 fires have burned across an area twice the size of Switzerland while 
claiming at least 28 lives and destroying thousands of homes, bellowing 
choking smoke thatas reached as far away as South America. Theyave also 
pumped out more than half the countryas annual carbon-dioxide emissions,
 another setback for the fight against climate change.   Choking Haze Is Turning Sydney Into the Worldas Laboratory   The costs are mounting. Economists estimate the wildfires and associated drought could cut  up to 
 half a percentage point off GDP growth as agriculture, tourism and 
sentiment take a hit. The drag on the economy comes at a time when 
Australia can ill afford it, with households already reining in spending
 in response to record-high debt and stagnant real wages.   The tournament, one of Australiaas key overseas tourism draw cards, brought in an estimated A $290 million  ( $200 million )
 last year with a record 780,000 people through the turnstiles, 
according to the Victoria state government. And as the tennis wraps up, 
the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix is scheduled to begin in the same 
city, an event that drew in more than 320,000 attendees in 2019.  "

 major syphilis outbreak is causing concern for medics in Victoria as 
the numbers of infected female patients soar for the first time.   More
 than 1,600 cases of the sexually transmitted disease were reported in 
the state in 2019 alone, up from just 654 cases in 2014.    Before 2014 the disease was largely confined to men but last year more than 150 women were diagnosed with the STI.    By 30 June 2018, there had been seven confirmed cases of congenital syphilis in babies and an additional six probable cases.   Six
 babies had died from congenital syphilis - three confirmed and three 
probable - associated with an outbreak which first began in a community 
in north-west Queensland before spreading, according to the  Department of Health .   'If
 you treat a woman, who has got syphilis early enough in pregnancy with 
the right penicillin it's 100 per cent preventable,' Monash University's
 Associate Professor Marcus Chen, from the Melbourne Sexual Health 
Centre told  The Age.     'These are tragic and avoidable cases.'    The primary suburbs for concern in recent times include the inner Melbourne CBD, Port Phillip, Yarra and Stonnington.   The disease, which is spread through skin-to-skin contact during unprotected sex, can have potentially fatal side effects.    Signs of syphilis usually begin with sores and can spread to a rash on the body (stock image pictured)   The
 infection begins with sores or wounds on the body, before spreading to a
 rash and potentially infecting the brain and causing dementia if left 
untreated.   Authorities believed the disease was eradicated in 
Melbourne by the 1990s, but a nationwide resurgence has impacted the 
city too.   'It's too simple to say there's more promiscuity, or 
more sex because people are meeting online and that's why it's gone 
rampant, because there's actually very little proof for that,' Professor
 Chen said.   Data collected by the Australian Department of Health 
concluded rates among women in the most recent figures were highest in 
15-19 year olds at 15.9 per 100,000, followed by the 20-24 age group and
 then 25-29.    Risks for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women were 40 times greater than non-indigenous women.    The disease is currently flaring up in women throughout Melbourne, which is of concern to authorities (stock image)     Advertisement    "

 Jan 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A deadly land dispute in Vietnam 
has led to a crackdown on social media posts, a sign of growing 
heavy-handedness by authorities as rising demand for land spurs more 
conflicts across the country, analysts and human rights activists said.   Four
 people were killed and dozens arrested last week in the northern 
village of Dong Tam near the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, as a 
long-running land dispute flared after a dawn raid by police.   Authorities
 said villagers attacked the troops with hand grenades, petrol bombs and
 knives, and were responsible for the deaths of the three policemen and a
 village leader.   Dong Tam residents said the police used excessive force.   This
 week, authorities said 22 of those arrested would face murder charges, 
and clamped down on social media posts about the clashes. Several 
activists have also been arrested for posts related to the incident, 
according to Amnesty International.   ""Social media is absolutely 
critical to land rights in Vietnam,"" Amnesty's regional director 
Nicholas Bequelin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday.   ""With
 neither independent media nor an independent judicial system, it is the
 only way to create significant pressure outside the community,"" he 
said, adding that the censorship was an ""unacceptable"" attack on freedom
 of expression.   A spokesman for Vietnam's ministry of information and communications did not respond to requests for comment.   The ministry of public security previously said it had launched an investigation into the clash.   Vietnam's
 cybersecurity law that went into effect last January has been 
criticised by human rights activists for giving authorities the power to
 censor expression and requiring service providers to take down any 
content deemed to be offensive.   For several years, Dong Tam's residents had protested what they said was the unfair seizure of land for a military airport.   Three
 years ago, villagers held dozens of local officials and policemen 
captive for several days after the arrest of several protesters. At the 
time, authorities had vowed to look into the dispute.   Social 
media ""played an important role in mobilising public support"" for the 
villagers back in 2017 said John Gillespie, a professor at Australia's 
Monash University, and an expert on land conflicts in Vietnam.   The government appears to have moved quickly to prevent it from happening this time, he said.   ""This
 case shows a worrying escalation in the level of force the government 
is prepared to use to suppress local objections to public infrastructure
 developments,"" Gillespie said.   Conflicts over land are common in
 Vietnam, where farmland was forcibly redistributed in the 1970s during 
Communist rule in the north.   Since the ruling Communist Party 
launched its economic reforms, or doi moi, in the late 1980s, more 
farming land has been taken to build highways and large industrial 
zones, sparking conflicts despite recent legislation aimed at protecting
 vulnerable communities.   (Reporting by Rina Chandran

of the worldas most dangerous volcanoes was the most aheartbreakinga 
moment of Juliet Cuentoas life.   The single mother of three, 52, who had to escort her 83-year-old 
mother out of the 8.6-mile evacuation zone around the erupting Taal 
volcano in the Philippines, pleaded with her uncle, Anacleto, 80, to 
join their escape from Barangay Tulo in Batangas province, some 45 miles
 from the capital, Manila.   aHe didnat want to go out of his house. I felt he was not aware of 
the danger he will face being alone when the whole town left already,a 
she said.   aMaybe heas weak and because of his past experience a few decades 
back of the volcanic activities, he thought that he wonat be affected,a 
she added. aI called a local government rescue team to ask for their 
help, but heas firm in his decision.a   Taal, a small but treacherous volcano that sits on a lake in a densely populated area, had been quiet for more than 40 years  when
 it suddenly spewed a plume of steaming ash from its crater on Sunday, 
in an eruption so huge that it could be spotted from space.     T he Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology 
(Phivolcs) has since monitored close to 600 volcanic quakes and has 
maintained the second highest alert, meaning a hazardous eruption is 
possible within hours to days.    L arge fissures have appeared in nearby towns, damaging 
buildings, and the institute recorded fresh adark grey ash plumesa of 
500 and 800 metres early on Thursday morning.   Close to half a million people reside in the evacuation zone, and at 
least 50,000 are currently being housed in makeshift shelters, while 
others like Ms Cuento have managed to rent apartments in Manila or stay 
with family.   Some, like Uncle Anacleto, have risked staying with their homes, or 
have ventured back to salvage their belongings and rescue animals 
blanketed in suffocating ash and thick mud.   Ms Cuento, who fears her bridal store may be looted, admits she was 
tempted to remain until the mayor ordered a mandatory evacuation using 
Facebook Live. aPeople were crying for help,a she said. aTrying to get 
out was a struggle. Big trucks were carrying the old and young.a   The close-knit family feared for their much-loved uncle and had gone 
back to check on him, she said. aWe trust God. I know He will protect us
 and we can go back home very, very soon,a she said.   Experts have warned residents not to underestimate the dangers of a 
volcano that has killed thousands during multiple explosive eruptions in
 the past few centuries.   aDangers include flows of hot ash and steam - small ones called 
surges, larger ones called pyroclastic flows -  across the water, 
which can destroy villages, as well as tsunamis that these flows could 
cause,a said Emeritus Professor Ray Cas of the Monash University School 
of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment. aHeavy falls of wet ash onto 
houses and other buildings can cause roofs to collapse.a    S ave the Children appealed this week for aid for an 
estimated 21,000 evacuated children who are at risk from respiratory 
illnesses and long-term physical and psychological setbacks.  "

 smoke from the Australian bushfires has circumnavigated the Earth, 
according to data compiled by NASA satellites in orbit around our 
planet.   NASA scientists have been  tracking the trajectory of the smoke and aerosols 
 since late December using data from the NOAA/NASA Suomi NPP satellite, 
linking the devastation of the bushfires with ""unprecedented"" conditions
 such as  searing heat and historic dryness .   These
 conditions have caused an abnormally large number of fire-generated 
thunderstorms known as pyrocumulonimbus events. Such thunderstorms have 
sent the bushfire smoke high into the atmosphere, helping to kickstart 
its journey around the world.   ""Pyrocumulonimbus events provide a pathway for smoke to reach the stratosphere  more than 10 miles in altitude ,""
 NASA wrote in a blog post last Thursday. ""Once in the stratosphere, the
 smoke can travel thousands of miles from its source, affecting 
atmospheric conditions globally.""       VIIRS
 Red-Green-Blue imagery provides a atrue-colora view of the smoke. (Note
 that these images do not represent what a human would see from orbit. 
In these images, the effect of Rayleigh scattering, which would add 
ablue haze,a has been taken out.) While useful, it is often hard to 
distinguish smoke over clouds and, sometimes, over dark ocean surfaces.    (NASA/Colin Seftor)    This
 smoke was lofted more than 9 miles high, NASA said. It drifted eastward
 across the South Pacific into New Zealand, where it caused severe air 
quality issues and visibly darkened mountaintop snow in the country 
about two weeks ago.   Andrew Mackintosh, head of the school of 
Earth, atmosphere and environment at Monash University and former 
director of the Antarctic Research Centre, estimated the dust could 
increase this seasonas glacier melt in New Zealand  by 20 to 30% .   aIt
 is quite common for dust to be transported to New Zealand glaciers, but
 I would say that the amount of transport right now is pretty phenomenal
 a  I donat think Iave ever seen anything like it ,a Mackintosh told the Guardian on Jan. 1. aIt is concerning to me to see so much material being deposited on the glaciers.a   By early last week, the smoke had traveled halfway around the world, detected in parts of South America, some  7,500 miles from its source in Australia . Skies turned hazy, causing colorful sunrises and sunsets.   Now,
 this week, that smoke has returned to Australia, completing its 
circumnavigation of the globe. The air quality in Australia was so poor 
Tuesday that professional tennis player Dalila Jakupovic collapsed 
during a qualifying match at the Australian Open.    (MORE:    Bushfire Smoke Causes Australian Open Player to Collapse   )    NASAas
 Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has been using all 
of the collected satellite data to create an ultraviolet (UV) aerosol 
index to track the smoke and aerosols that originated from the 
Australian bushfires.   ""The UV index has a characteristic that is 
particularly well suited for identifying and tracking smoke from 
pyrocumulonimbus events: the higher the smoke plume, the larger the 
aerosol index value. Values over 10 are often associated with such 
events,"" said Colin Seftor, research scientist at Goddard. ""The aerosol 
index values produced by some of the Australian pyrocumulonimbus events 
have rivaled the largest values ever recorded.""       The
 UV aerosol index is a qualitative product that can easily detect smoke 
(and dust) over all types of land surfaces. The aerosol index values 
produced by some of the Australian pyrocumulonimbus events have rivaled 
the largest ever recorded.    (NASA/Colin Seftor)    Astronauts
 aboard the International Space Station shared photos on Twitter showing
 their view of the smoke and ash as they orbited high above the Earth.   ""An immense ash cloud covers Australia as we fly  toward the sunset ,"" Luca Parmitano, astronaut with the European Space Agency, tweeted on Monday.   More
 than two dozen people have been killed by the Australian bushfires,

 started play on Monday, tournament officials were still monitoring a 
potential environmental crisis as a result of Australia's ongoing 
bushfires.   For all of the concerns about air quality, it turned 
out that the biggest issue related to playing conditions on Day 1 was 
heavy rain.   Last week, Tennis Australia boss and Australian Open 
tournament director Craig Tiley said that when it becomes obvious that 
smoke could have an impact, officials are prepared to act for the 
welfare of all involved, including players, fans and staff. Tennis 
Australia said it will work with its medical team, the Bureau of 
Meteorology and Environment Protection Authority Victoria scientists 
when making decisions about whether it's healthy to play.   Here are some frequently asked questions regarding the impact the bushfires could have on the first Grand Slam of the year:   Melbourne,
 home of the Australian Open, is the capital and most populous city of 
Victoria, one of the six states that make up Australia. The city is in 
the southeast corner of the country, along the coast where most people 
live and most of the bushfires have been burning. The major cities have 
largely been spared, but dense smoke has caused severe problems in some 
places, such as the Australian capital of Canberra. An ATP Challenger 
event scheduled for Canberra in early January had to be moved about 400 
miles west to Bendigo because of excessive smoke in the atmosphere.   On
 Dec. 30, about 100,000 people were urged to flee five Melbourne suburbs
 as a heat wave combined with high winds left the city suffocatingly hot
 and dense with smoke. One firefighter was killed on the outlying 
countryside. While fire is the preeminent danger, smoke -- sometimes 
driven over great distances by wind -- is a more sinister threat that 
cannot be fought.   The situation in the state of Victoria has forced  @vicemergency 
 (the state's official alert system) to issue at least one recent 
emergency warning of ""imminent"" danger from a bushfire for Noorinbee, 
230 miles east of Melbourne. ""You are in danger and need to act 
immediately to survive,"" the warning said.   There
 appears to be little danger from fires at the moment, but heat is 
always a factor Down Under. This year, smoke -- and the toxic elements 
it carries -- is an active concern, especially in combination with the 
familiar Melbourne heat.   The city has already closed a number of 
beaches and pools, sporting events have been canceled, and construction 
workers have been forced to abandon outdoor projects. Ambulance calls 
for people struggling to breathe have also risen significantly.   The
 smoky days at the start of the new year spurred many people to purchase
 P2 and N95 masks. The Australian Medical Association has advised people
 with preexisting lung or heart conditions, as well as those sensitive 
to smoke, to take special precautions. Many have purchased the common, 
relatively inexpensive, small respirators that slip over the nose and 
mouth -- the ones commonly used by house painters, woodworkers and 
others. Visitors to Australia have been advised to bring their own.   In
 a statement issued to the media on Jan. 6, Tiley said: ""There will be 
meteorological and air quality experts onsite to analyse all available 
live data and assess in real-time the air quality at Melbourne Park, and
 we always work closely with our medical personnel and other local 
experts.""   On Tuesday morning, with Melbourne's air quality 
officially ranked third-worst in the world, Tiley and chief operating 
officer Tom Larner fronted a hastily arranged media opportunity to 
assure that the tournament would act in the best interests of the 
players, fans and staff.   ""This is a new experience for all of us in how we manage air quality, so we have to listen to the experts,"" Tiley said.   On
 Friday, Australian Open organizers belatedly published details of their
 ""Air Quality Policy,"" confirming that play at the first Grand Slam 
event of the year could be stopped if conditions are considered to be 
adverse to players' health.   Responding to criticism from players 
who said they had not been fully informed earlier in the week, when 
smoke from the bushfires blew into Melbourne during the qualifying 
event, officials released the policy.   However, the decision of whether to stop play will still be largely at the discretion of the tournament referee.   The
 Air Quality Rating (AQI) consists of five bands from one to five, 
""determined by analyzing concentrations of air pollutants at Melbourne 
Park and in particular, the fine particulate matter rating (PM2.5).""   Play
 is allowed under the first three bands -- ""good"" (below 27), ""moderate""
 (27-62) and ""air may affect sensitive groups"" (62-97) -- but if the 
level is between 97 and 200, ""match play may be suspended,"" though that 
will be up to the tournament referee.   If the rating is in the fifth band -- more than 200 -- then play will automatically be suspended.   The
 publication of the policy came three days after organizers were heavily
 criticized for allowing play to go on when a number of players 
complained of breathing difficulties at the qualifying event.   The AQI reading from the station nearest Rod Laver Arena on Monday morning was 427, which is considered ""hazardous.""   Tennis Australia has never had an air-quality policy because it has never before been a significant issue.   Due
 to the constant threat of excessive heat, tournament officials have 
established sophisticated protocols for measuring conditions, including 
the  WetBulb Globe Temperature  (WBGT), and the tournament has a transparent  extreme-heat policy  in place. It features a five-step  Australian Open heat-stress scale 
 that measures heat-related factors that trigger a variety of remedial 
actions, from brief breaks to suspension of play sitewide.   Over 
the years, those protocols have evolved from a simple dictate in 1998 to
 suspend play when the temperature hit 104 degrees Fahrenheit to a suite
 of responses depending on the temperature and WBGT index (which takes 
factors other than temperature, including humidity, into consideration).
 The measures include closing the roof on covered courts during day 
matches, heat-mandated 10-minute breaks between sets and stoppages of at
 least two hours.   The athletes have various ways of dealing with 
heat, including iced towels, appropriate headgear, misting fans, 
frequent changes of clothing and strategies that include prematch 
hydration at hourly intervals, salt tablets, etc. But there's little 
that anyone can do to help the air quality. Masks might help, but they 
impair oxygen intake. Inhalers that soothe sore throats might provide 
temporary relief from soreness, but they could also mask the damage 
being done.   Both
 the ATP and WTA have told ESPN.com that they are leaving decisions 
about the playing conditions in the hands of Tennis Australia. But 
Djokovic told reporters that he put air-quality considerations on the 
agenda at the annual player meeting that precedes the tournament.   That's
 a good idea, given Tennis Australia's lack of a transparent mechanism 
for determining when to pull the plug on play due to hazardous air 
quality.   While practicing in Melbourne during the worst days of smoke in early January,  Denis Kudla 
 told The New York Times, ""If it's anything like yesterday, I don't 
think it would be safe over a two-, three-week period. You could play 
[in the Australian Open], but who knows what damage we're actually 
causing ourselves? It can't be good.""   It
 sounds far-fetched, but in a worst-case scenario, the Australian Open 
could become the first hybrid outdoor-indoor tournament. That's because 
the National Tennis Center has four roofed stadiums as well as eight 
indoor courts. The air circulation systems in the roofed venues include 
some filtration, but earlier this month in Sydney, the smoke overwhelmed
 some air-conditioning units and triggered smoke alarms in some 
buildings. Tiley said, ""[We have] effectively weatherproofed the 
Australian Open.""   We might yet see whether that also means they have smoke-proofed it.   Some
 players struggled with breathing during qualifying last week, when the 
air was among the worst in the world because of smoke from fires 100 
miles away. On Monday, though, all appeared to be fine.   ""Today, it seemed normal,""  Serena Williams  said after her first-round victory. ""Yeah, it seemed pretty good.""   During
 qualifiers, smoke and hazy conditions at Melbourne Park affected the 
players, with organizers criticized for allowing matches to proceed. The
 start of qualifying was delayed by an hour on Tuesday due to the smoky 
haze, but practice sessions were canceled.   A number of players complained, including Australian  Bernard Tomic , who sought medical treatment after he struggled to breathe during his first-round loss. Slovenia's  Dalila Jakupovic  said she feared she would pass out before she retired from her match after collapsing to her knees with a coughing spell.   ""I
 was really scared that I would collapse,"" Jakupovic said. ""That's why I
 went onto the floor -- because I couldn't walk anymore.""   Australian
 Open officials delayed play by three hours during qualifiers on 
Wednesday, but the air-quality index was still graded as ""unhealthy"" 
when the players took to the court.   On Thursday, British player  Liam Broady  accused Australian Open officials of treating qualifiers worse than animals. Calls are growing among players to form a union.   Tiley
 addressed the criticism from players saying: ""Our medical team were 
satisfied with the conditions that the players were competing in [in 
qualifying], per all of the research and the data and the science that 
they have.   ""But they also make an assessment. You could have been 
two hours into those matches and have 25 people presenting themselves 
with a medical condition that may be related to the pollutants.""   The
 ATP and WTA Player Councils met separately on Friday in Melbourne, with
 smoke and playing conditions high on the agenda at both.   Despite the concerns, many of the top tennis players have vowed to support Australians suffering because of the bushfires.    Nick Kyrgios 
 got the ball rolling when he pledged to donate $140 (U.S.) for every 
ace he hit during the ATP Cup. Scores of ATP and WTA players followed 
suit. Williams donated her $43,000 ASB Classic winner's check to 
Australian wildfires victims. The ATP donated $725,000 on behalf of the 
players, and the ITF will contribute an additional $400,000.    Roger Federer ,  Rafael Nadal ,
 Kyrgios, Williams and others took part in a Rally for Relief bushfire 
charity exhibition at Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday. According to Tennis 
Australia, the event raised nearly $3.5 million for the bushfire relief 
effort. The event drew a capacity crowd of more than 15,000. During the 
event, Nadal announced that he and Federer would combine to donate 
$250,000. Despite the drive to support the bushfire victims.   During
 Saturday's media day, Federer led a chorus of criticism of tournament 
organizers for their handling of events earlier this week. Federer said 
he had made a point of going to see tournament officials when conditions
 were at their worst to try to find out the rules.   ""I said, 'I think we're all confused. Is it super unsafe, or is it totally safe to play?'"" he said.   Nadal
 said he also consulted tournament officials and was content with their 
explanation, but other players were more forthright in their criticism.   Canadian  Denis Shapovalov 
 said the players had been ""left in the dark,"" it was ""scary,"" and he 
would refuse to play if he felt the conditions were unsafe, regardless 
of what the tournament says.    Information from the Associated Press, AAP and Reuters contributed to this report.   "

 smartwatch band with integrated electrodes to produce an 
electrocardiogram (ECG) might be able to help detect atrial 
fibrillation, but not as well as a traditional ECG machine used in a 
hospital, a recent study suggests.     Researchers compared results 
for 200 people who had ECGas done using both an FDA-approved smartwatch 
heart rhythm monitor called the AliveCor KardiaBand and a traditional 
ECG machine used in many doctorsa offices and hospitals.     The 
band was manufactured to be used with Apple smartwatches. AliveCor 
doesnat sell them anymore, but many people are still using them.    When
 the band predicted atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm 
irregularity, it was correct about 55% of the time, the study found. And
 when the band predicted that people did not have atrial fibrillation, 
it was right about 98% of the time.     aBased on these findings, at
 this stage it would be recommended that healthcare professionals remain
 an integral part of the use of such technology in order to avoid 
unnecessary treatment and anxiety,a said lead study author Dr. Kevin 
Rajakariar of Box Hill Hospital and Monash University in Victoria, 
Australia in an email. aAlthough there is potential for population 
screening for atrial fibrillation and monitoring atrial fibrillation 
burden in those already diagnosed, at this stage, further studies are 
required to define the precise role of these devices within the 
healthcare system.a    In atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses 
in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic, causing the heart muscle
 to quiver rather than contracting normally. As a result, blood doesnat 
move as well through the heart. This can lead to formation of clots that
 can travel through the arteries to the brain and cause a stroke.    The
 wearable band produces an ECG reading when people who have it on a 
wrist place a finger from the opposite hand on an electrode on top of 
the band. This creates a circuit with an electrode on the back of the 
watch thatas in contact with the skin.     Wearable devices like the
 smartwatch band that works with the Apple watch to take ECGs and detect
 heart rhythm disorders like atrial fibrillation are becoming 
increasingly popular with consumers, researchers note in Heart.     If
 proven to be accurate, these devices have the potential to be used to 
screen for heart rhythm disorders like atrial fibrillation at the 
population level, potentially identifying people who need to start 
taking blood thinners to lower their risk of stroke, the study team 
notes.     In the current study, researchers concluded that the 
smartwatch band with the ECG ademonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracya
 when compared to a traditional EGC.     One limitation of the study
 is that participants had a much higher prevalence of atrial 
fibrillation than the general population, at 19% compared with just 
2%-5% by most population estimates, the study team notes.     Itas 
also possible that results might be less accurate at predicting atrial 
fibrillation when used by consumers on their own, outside the context of
 a clinical trial where they got support from researchers in using the 
device, the study team also points out.     aRecording and analyzing
 the rhythm using wearables could be an asset for the management of 
patients with atrial fibrillation,a said Dr. Khaldoun Tarakji, director 
of the Heart and Vascular Institute Center for Digital Health 
Technologies and Telemedicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.     Wearables
 like the band in this study might help diagnose patients who have 
intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, Tarakji, who wasnat 
involved in the study, said by email. They might also help monitor 
patients with the condition to determine what treatment they need or 
follow their symptoms after treatment.    aHowever, the concern with
 widespread use of these wearables among asymptomatic patients is the 
possibility of false positive results that can trigger more testing and 
unnecessary interventions,a Tarakji said.     SOURCE:  bit.ly/2swrvJW  Heart, online January 7, 2020.      "

 still smouldering when firefighters escorted a small team of biologists
 into Kosciusko National Park in southern New South Wales on 15 January.   The
 expedition, granted a rare exemption from the parkas strict no-go 
policy during this record-breaking fire season, was to prevent one of 
Australiaas rarest fish from going extinct.   Rain forecast for the 
following day threatened to wash ash from the fires into the mountain 
streams, smothering the last remaining  Galaxias tantangara , a 
species of mountain minnow found in a single three-kilometre stretch of 
the Tantangara Creek. The expeditioners collected 142 fish as an 
insurance population to be bred in captivity, a first for the species, 
in case it disappears in the wild.   aIn this situation, theyare 
more important than koalas, [because] weare not going to lose koalas

2014.   As blazes of unprecedented size continue to rage across 
Australia, the full extent of the devastation is still unknown. 
Fire-affected regions remain off-limits to all but a few researchers due
 to safety risks, but some, having consulted satellite images and fire 
maps, fear the worst.   Some studies have been set back months or 
years. Destroyed scientific equipment and derailed research projects 
must be added to the calamitous toll of lives, homes and businesses 
lost.   Remote sensing specialist, Will Woodgate, from the 
University of Queensland, manages a site in the Bago State Forest in the
 alpine region of southeast Australia, as part of Terrestrial Ecosystem 
Research Network (TERN), a nationwide array that gathers data on land 
surface conditions to feed into global climate models.   A 70-metre 
tower at the centre of the site, one of 20 in the network, is connected 
to sensors and equipment with a combined value of $A500,000. As fire 
tore through the site at 3 pm on New Yearas Eve, the stream of data that
 has flowed from there for 20 years stopped.   Photos of the site 
from the NSW Forestry Corporation show that the understory of the forest
 has been wiped out, but the canopy is intact. The tower still stands, 
so sensors at the top of the tower could have survived the blaze, says 
Woodgate.   But power cables and two shipping container storage 
units housing computers, a battery bank and communications equipment are
 scorched.   aAll our equipment inside those sheds could have been melted,a says Woodgate.   The
 siteas generator and on-ground sensors may also be destroyed. The 
repair bill could top $100,000, says Woodgate, not to mention the time 
and effort required to get the site back up and running. It could be 
months before scientists get the go-ahead to even physically assess the 
damage, he says.   A handful of the 700 TERN sites without permanent
 infrastructure a on Kangaroo Island off the coast of southern 
Australia, for instance a have also been burnt.   Ecologist,
 Ross Crates, from the Australian National University, studies the 
critically endangered Regent Honeyeater, a petite nomadic bird with 
fewer than 400 individuals remaining in the wild.   Finding and 
counting the honeyeaters has just got a lot harder because fires may 
have wiped out about 20% of their habitat, forests in the Greater Blue 
Mountains World Heritage Site, says Crates. He thinks it could take 
years before the fate of the honeyeater is known.   If the bird has 
shifted to new habitat as a result of the fires, ait almost puts us back
 to square one,a he says. aItas pretty heart-breaking.a   For 
researchers working directly with species affected, fires can exact an 
emotional toll, wildlife ecologist, Euan Ritchie, from Deakin University
 points out. aIt's almost like a member of your family being very 
strongly adversely affected, so people take that pretty hard,a he 
says.regent honeyeater   Aquatic ecologist, Ross Thompson, from the 
University of Canberra says that he has spent the past few days 
counselling students whose research has been affected by the fire.   aIf
 you're trying to do a three and a half year PhD and you have a big fire
 in the middle of it, it can have a pretty significant effect on whether
 you've got enough data to get done,a he says.Research delayed   Plant
 ecophysiologist, Ros Gleadow, of Monash University in Melbourne, says 
the fire could delay one of her experiments by several years. A site in 
East Gippsland, in southeast Australia, home to the southern-most 
population of a native species of sorghum, Sorghum leiocladum, has been 
burnt.   The wild relative of commercially cultivated sorghum, being
 investigated for useful genes, may return, but not in time for one of 
Gleadowas students to collect data on it for his PhD thesis.   aEven
 if it comes back, we won't have the funding or the opportunity to do 
this experiment again probably for a few years,a she says. Seeds from 
the population havenat yet been added to a dedicated seed bank, 
underlining the importance of such facilities in safeguarding against 
the loss of species, she says.   Research at the newly established 
Australian Mountain Research Facility lead by the Australian National 
University in Canberra has also been postponed. The multi-institutional 
facility, which is set to study the effects of a changing climate on 
alpine landscapes, had planned to deploy sensors and monitoring 
equipment to its eight field sites this summer.   Fire at one of 
those sites, in the Snowy Mountains, has left anothing but bare soil,a 
says soil scientist Zach Brown from Australian National University in 
Canberra and the senior technical officer for the project. With fires 
still threatening other sites, installation of equipment across the 
network has been set back by a year, says Brown.   As
 ruinous as the fires have been, ecologists are preparing to make the 
most of the situation. aDisturbances are one of the ways we learn about 
ecology best,a says Thompson.   On 10 January, ecologists in 
Victoria met to discuss the extent of the damage across the state. 
According to a government report from the meeting leaked to The Age 
newspaper, fires have incinerated large chunks of habitat for several 
endangered species in south-eastern Australia, including the sooty owl, 
the long-nosed bandicoot, and the diamond python.   The fires 
present an opportunity to ramp up management of introduced herbivores 
such as deer and pigs while numbers are down and tree cover has been 
opened up, exposing them for aerial shooting, says Ritchie, who attended
 the meeting.   Ecologist, Michael Clarke, from La Trobe University 
in Melbourne ,is experienced at creating gains from fire losses. Clarke 
had been studying mating systems in birds when in 2003, fires burnt 
through his field sites on Wilsonas Promontory in southeast Australia.   aIn
 my case, it changed my research direction in a productive way,a says 
Clarke. He turned to investigating how fire management, including 
controlled burns to reduce fire hazard, affects ecosystems. aThe more I 
delved into the ecological basis of fire management, the less confident I
 was that it was based on really good science,a says Clarke.   Heas been trying to fill that gap ever since.  "

   Hope for an effective and inexpensive treatment for the deadly 
condition sepsis has dimmed following results of a major new study.   Researchers
 had hoped that a simple treatment involving infusions of vitamin C, 
vitamin B1 and steroids would work against a disease that kills an 
estimated 270,000 people each year in the United States and 11 million 
globally. Sepsis, or blood poisoning, occurs when the body overreacts to
 infection. It leads to leaky blood vessels, which can cause multiple 
organ failure.   Excitement about this treatment took off in 
early 2017, when a well-regarded physician and researcher in Norfolk, 
Va., Dr. Paul Marik,  reported that he had remarkable results 
 treating his sepsis patients using this combination of agents. Some 
doctors in intensive care units started using the method immediately, 
based on those early results. Many others said they wanted to wait for 
results of a more carefully controlled study         The largest scientific study published to date has now reported 
its findings. It finds no benefit at all from the ""Marik cocktail."" It 
involved more than 200 patients in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. 
Results were  presented Friday at a meeting  in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and were  published online Friday in   JAMA , the journal of the American Medical Association.    Dr. Rinaldo Bellomo ,
 at Austin Hospital and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, led 
the research team. He decided to study the treatment because sepsis 
takes such a large toll a it's a leading cause of death in hospitals a 
and treatment options are limited. There's no effective drug, though 
aggressive use of antibiotics and careful care in the ICU can help.   ""People
 latch on to promising interventions because of that frustration,"" he 
tells NPR. ""And it's understandable. But, you know, the view from here 
is that we shouldn't substitute hope for evidence.""   His evidence does not support those who believe the vitamin C treatment is effective.   ""It is discouraging,"" says  Dr. Craig Coopersmith ,
 interim director of the Emory Critical Care Center at Emory University.
 ""Right now, sepsis is the number three cause of death in the United 
States and the number one or two cause of death in the world.""    Coopersmith
 says the results don't slam the door on the treatment entirely a 
there's still some chance that it has a modest effect on overall 
survival, he says, but the study didn't involve enough patients to 
answer that question. The study found no effect on short-term survival 
or improvement in certain clinical markers of disease.   ""I don't
 think we can yet say that there is no impact,"" Coopersmith says. ""I 
think we could say that the jury's still out on that.""   He 
assumes that doctors who are inclined toward using the treatment will 
continue to do so, at least for now, while those who adopted a 
wait-and-see approach are sticking with that.    Indeed, Marik, 
who remains a strong proponent of this approach, rejects the findings of
 the study. He tells NPR that by his reckoning, patients in the study 
received treatment far too late in the course of their disease. ""It's 
like giving it to a patient who's dead,"" he says. ""It's of no benefit. 
The horse was out of the barn miles beforehand.""   Marik, at 
Eastern Virginia Medical School, gives his patients the vitamin C 
infusion as quickly as he recognizes signs of sepsis. That's impossible 
to do in a study in which participants must be enrolled in a study and 
then randomized into one of the two comparison groups before treatment 
can begin.   ""The question is, why does this study not replicate 
real-life experience and the experience of hundreds of clinicians around
 the world?"" he asks.   Marik says in his experience, the 
treatment is only effective if given within six hours after someone has 
suspected sepsis. At the meeting in Belfast, Dr. Tomoko Fujii, on the 
study research team at Monash University, said they provided treatment 
an average of 12 hours after patients arrived in the intensive care 
unit. Patients came from a variety of locations, including the emergency
 room, and she said they have no information about how long they had 
been septic before arriving at the ICU.   Coopersmith is part of  a larger study 
 a involving 501 patients a that has also put the vitamin C protocol to 
the test. That research group has completed collecting data and is now 
in the process of analyzing the results and preparing a publication. A 
second group, coordinated out of Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center,  also studied the protocol  among a group of about 200 patients.   Findings
 from those studies should help doctors and researchers come to a more 
definitive conclusion, says Bellomo in Australia. ""I think that will be 
really good, because we would have a much larger body of evidence. I 
hope by the end of 2020 to provide more nuanced and more detailed views 
of what happens with this kind of intervention.""    You can contact NPR Science Correspondent Richard Harris at    rharris@npr.org   .   "

 (Reuters) - The poor air quality which left players fighting for breath
 at Melbourne Park last week, and the extreme heat which disrupted the 
tournament in the past, will become the new norm if sports do not do 
more to address climate change, a report released on Monday said.         FILE

January 16, 2020   General view of flags infront of the Melbourne 
Skyline   REUTERS/Ciro De Luca/File Photo    The
 Australian Open, the seasonas first Grand Slam, starts later on Monday 
but the lead-up was blighted by smoke from bushfires that have raged 
across Australia for months.    Slovenian Daria Jakupovic said she 
was ascareda after a coughing fit forced her out of qualifying on 
Tuesday while Canadian Denis Shapovalov said he would refuse to play 
this week if forced to compete when the air quality was poor.    The
 Monash University report, titled aLove 40, degreesa, said extreme heat 
and weather events would have a growing impact on sport in Australia.    aThis
 is not something that has happened,a James Goldie, the reportas 
co-author, told Reuters. aThis is something that is happening. And itas 
going to get worse.a    Goldie and co-author Stephanie Hall examined
 the effects of climate change on three high-profile sports events held 
in the Australian summer a the Boxing Day cricket test in Melbourne, 
cyclingas Tour Down Under in South Australia, and the Australian Open 
tennis Grand Slam.    The reports all indicated that sports 
organizations should consider shifting their events to either November 
or March, or modifying their times to start earlier in the morning or 
compete later at night.    aIt doesnat matter what sport youare 
playing, there are multiple tracks of evidence that summer sports across
 the board are going to be impacted by climate change and extreme heat,a
 Hall said.    Sports organizations have adopted extreme heat 
policies but in recent years Tennis Australia has been criticized for 
not postponing play when players were showing signs of distress.    Novak
 Djokovic retired from his quarter-final in 2009 due to heat stress 
while defending the title as the temperature hit 45 Celsius (113 
Fahrenheit).    In 2018, Franceas Alize Cornet collapsed when court 
surface temperatures reached 69 Celsius, while her compatriot Gael 
Monfils said he felt like he was adyinga.    The
 bushfire crisis has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison as 
critics say he has not done enough to address the impact of climate 
change, which meteorologists have said was extending the length of the 
fire weather season.    Bushfires are common in Australia but the 
fire season has begun much earlier than usual, with temperatures soaring
 above 40 Celsius well ahead of the start of the southern summer and 
high winds hitting the drought-parched landscape.    Morrison on 
Friday again rejected any links between the fires and his conservative 
governmentas policies, including support for the coal industry.    Gavan
 McFadzean, the Climate Change Program Manager at the Australian 
Conservation Foundation, which commissioned the research, said it should
 serve as a wake-up call for sports organizations to do more to address 
climate change.    aTheyare not doing enough,a he said. aTheyare not
 ... pushing for stronger ambition from our political and business 
leaders on climate change.    aSport is a critical institution and plays an important role in bringing people together and shifting community attitudes.    aThere has never been a more important role that sport can play.a    Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford  "

 Australian Open should be moved to a shoulder season or extended by a 
week to avoid extreme heat risks for players, Victorian researchers have
 suggested.   Players have described the hot conditions at the 
Australian Open as brutal, while four-time winner Andre Agassi likened 
the experience to ""playing in a giant kiln"".   Monash University 
researchers have found health risks and match disruptions are an 
increasing risk because of climate change and that the event should 
adapt to protect players.   They found Tennis Australia has an opportunity to make a statement to the world on climate action and to safeguard the event.   Moving
 the Australian grand slam to November or March is one suggested option,
 a report for the Australian Conservation Foundation released on Monday 
said.   But that could cause immediate issues for tennis officials 
and their jammed-packed schedule, while long-term modelling suggests 
temperatures in those months will be as high as they are currently in 
January, by 2060.   An alternative could be to extend the event by a week, reducing playing time during the hottest part of the day.   But
 researchers noted in the ""Love 40 Degrees?"" report that current 
Victorians school holidays end after the event and that extending the 
tournament could affect ticketing.   ""While neither option is 
without risk, this is the unfortunate reality of outdoor sports in a 
changing climate,"" the researchers from Monash's Climate Change 
Communication Research Hub said.   Tennis Australia last year 
signed on to the United Nation's Sports for Climate Action Framework and
 established a sustainability business unit to ""encourage a culture of 
sustainability"" and plans to assess carbon impact during this year's 
tournament.   Researchers noted a ""significant increase"" in average
 daytime temperatures and extreme heat days in the tournament's 115-day 
history.   The Australian Open became the first grand slam tournament to implement a heat policy in 1998.   It
 was replaced last year with a new policy based on radiant heat, 
humidity, air temperature and wind speed data recorded around Melbourne 
Park.   It uses increased hydration, cooling strategies and 
extended breaks as steps to address heat stress before suspending play 
in the worst conditions.   Researchers said Tennis Australia and 
Australian Open organisers declined to tell them whether they have a 
tracking system for days when play was delayed or abandoned because of 
extreme heat, per season.   Last year, play was suspended on one day. A year earlier, court surface temperatures reached 69C.   In
 2014, play continued on four days when temperatures were above 41C. 
Nine players withdrew and more than 1000 attendees were treated for 
heat-related illnesses.   The report also notes the effect bushfire smoke can have on players, impacting their performance and long-term health.     Advertisement    "

left more than two dozen people dead and burned 10 million hectares 
(40,000 sq miles) of land.    The fires are expected to last for many weeks yet - and the recovery process will go on for many years.    So is it safe to travel to Australia? Were these fires caused by criminal arson? And what can we all do to help?    We answer some of your questions here.    This has been a huge talking point in recent weeks. And yes, some of the fires were due to arson,  as they are every year .    But the widely circulated figure of nearly 200 people arrested for deliberately starting fires is inaccurate.        Media playback is unsupported on your device    Police in New South Wales said in January 183 people had been charged since November 2019 
 over ""bushfire-related offences"". Of those, 24 were accused of 
deliberately lighting fires. The rest were over failures to comply with 
total fire bans - perhaps by lighting a campfire - or things such as 
discarding cigarettes or matches.    In Victoria, police say there 
is no evidence the huge East Gippsland or North East fires were caused 
by arson or suspicious activity. Queensland Police say of the 1,068 
bushfires in the state since September, 114 (about 10%) have been 
""deliberately or maliciously lit through human involvement"".   Paul 
Read, a lecturer and natural disasters expert at Monash University, 
wrote in research published last November that in general, just under  90% of Australian bushfires were caused by human activity , which includes deliberate arson, carelessness or recklessness.   About 13% of the 62,000 fires a year in Australia are caused by lightning strikes, says Mr Read,  which is what sparked the massive Gospers Mountain blaze . And of course how a fire starts has little to no effect on how big it will become.    Australian
 officials say anyone who wants to help should send money via official 
fundraising websites. The Australian Red Cross, RSCPA and Salvation Army
 are among the charities running special appeals. The largely volunteer 
fire services also take donations.    What people in affected areas say they don't need is
 donations of food, clothing or other physical contributions. Emergency 
officials say they have no way of storing or distributing these items 
and what people on the ground really need is cash.   Officials are 
also warning to be cautious - many fake charity pages have sprung up, 
some claiming to be in the name of people killed in fires. Officials in 
Victoria have said some scammers are even cold-calling homes to solicit 
donations.    Australia is very big and  the government body Tourism Australia says: ""Many areas are unaffected and most tourism businesses are still open.""  But it has suspended its UK ad campaign, featuring Kylie Minogue, while the fires are dominating the news.   It
 says people visiting Australia should check the most recent advice 
before departing and ""remain informed about changing conditions whilst 
on the ground"", through government agencies, the Bureau of Meteorology 
and local tourism staff.    There's no advice at present to avoid travelling to Australia.  The current guidance from the UK's Foreign Office 
 is to monitor local media if you're in or near affected areas. It warns
 ""poor air quality can occur some distance from the sites of the fires 
and provoke respiratory conditions"" and advises remaining across local 
official advice. The US is giving similar advice.    If you no 
longer want to travel Australia, the first step is to contact the 
company or agent you booked through to seek their advice. At the moment,
 UK tour companies are not obliged to offer a refund if you want to 
cancel.   If you have travel insurance, contact your insurer to ask 
what your options are. Many policies do not cover natural disasters. Of 
course, many tourism sites will be very keen for visitors to start 
coming back and spending as soon as possible.    The
 Australian Defence Force (ADF) became visibly involved in the operation
 in late December, when ships and aircraft were sent to Victoria to help
 firefighters tackling blazes in East Gippsland and  to evacuate people trapped in the coastal town of Mallacoota.      But the ADF has been involved in the firefighting effort in some capacity since early September.     Australia's states and territories are responsible for their own disaster responses but, according to  Australia's disaster response plan,  they can ask for federal help if they ""cannot reasonably cope with the needs of the situation"".   The ADF stresses it is not trained or equipped to be a firefighting force.   There's a long way to go before this is over. Australia's fire season usually continues until well into March.    Some
 plants and forests have evolved to cope with or even - in the case of 
eucalyptus trees - thrive on fires. But the scale and intensity of these
 fires has been unprecedented, so there is fear  even seeds deep in the 
soil may have been damaged.    ""Until the fires subside, the full extent of damage will remain unknown,"" says Dr Stuart Blanch, of WWF-Australia.   But many burned areas ""will take decades to recover and some species may have tipped over the brink of extinction"".    Dr
 Blanch says some forests will never recover, while it will most likely 
be decades before some trees will be big enough to have the holes needed
 for animals to live in.    ""Hence the damage from these fires could last at least two centuries,"" he says.   That's a real concern now. Dairy Farmers Australia says about 70 farms have been hit. Thousands of cattle have been killed.  BBC News spoke to one farmer who said he might now just have to sell up.     The
 Foundation for Rural Regeneration and Renewal, a not-for-profit agency 
that gives grants to help recover from fires, says for many communities 
""help will be needed for many years to come"".   How quickly farmland
 recovers depends on the size and heat of the fire. Most crops would of 
course be lost - though some growing underground may survive - so will 
need replanting.  But flames can burn the nitrogen out  of soil, meaning farmers will have to add nutrients, possibly for years.     Fruit and olive trees 
 may actually survive a fire, even if they're severely damaged, but will
 take a few years before they fully recover. And of course the costs for
 farmers could be astronomical.    The Insurance Council of Australia says overall  A$700m (APS370m) in losses have been filed so far.         Media playback is unsupported on your device   Several countries have sent firefighting experts or equipment to help out. Among them:  "

 to address the causes of climate change and part of that was looking at
 their sponsors.   aOne of the major sponsors of the Australian Open is the ANZ bank. Of
 the big four (banks), theyare the biggest investor in coal and gas in 
Australia,a he said.   aSo one of Tennis Australiaas major sponsors is contributing to the climate change that is affecting the Australian Open.a   McFadzean also said athletes need to step up.   aThis is their working environment and it is changing,a he added. 
aThere have been several players complaining about the air quality in 
Melbourne.""   aBut we would like players to draw out the link between those 
conditions and the causes ... because athletes are influential and have a
 stake in voicing their concerns.a   The bushfire crisis has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison
 as critics say he has not done enough to address the impact of climate 
change, which meteorologists have said extends the length of the fire 
weather season.   Bushfires are common in Australia but the fire season began much 
earlier than usual, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius 
well ahead of the start of the southern summer and high winds hitting 
the drought-parched landscape.   Morrison has rejected any links between the fires and his 
conservative governmentas policies, including support for the coal 
industry.   Source:     A(c)

The spread of Chinaas mysterious deadly coronavirus  could accelerate rapidly as hundreds of millions prepare to   travel home for the Lunar New Year holiday  this week and as citizens bemoan the measures authorities are taking so far.    The country is scrambling 
 to halt the spread of 2019-nCoV, also known as the Wuhan virus. The 
infection originated in a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, a large city
 in central China.   Three people in the city have died from the illness,  local health authorities said . The total number of infections in the country was 217 as of Monday,   according to Reuters .   The virus has also spread to the Chinese cities of Beijing and Shenzhen, as well as South Korea, Thailand, and Japan.   Not much is known about the Wuhan virus, apart its pneumonialike 
symptoms a like a fever and difficulty breathing- and identification as a
 strain of coronavirus infecting the nose, throat, or sinuses. It has 
been likened to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.   Experts have warned the virus could be further spread by human-to-human contact, though the  World Health Organisation has said  animals appear to be the most likely source of the outbreak.

Health authorities across Asia are ramping up measures to spot and contain people carrying the disease, with   medics in hazmat suits taking passengersa temperatures  before planes can fly out from Wuhan and various airports increasing health screenings of people travelling from China.   The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is screening incoming passengers from China at airports in  New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,  as are health authorities in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo.   Chinese President Xi Jinping also called for increased focus on the 
disease, saying in a statement cited by state TV, aPeopleas lives and 
health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak 
should be resolutely curbed,a according to Reuters.   Mask sales have also surged in Wuhan, with one employee at a Beike 
Drug Store branch telling Reuters demand has grown 10 times since the 
outbreak. (Itas not entirely clear if masks provide effective protection
 against the disease.)       Reuters  Medical staff near the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan, which houses patients with the Wuhan coronavirus, on January 10.    But many citizens say the precautions are far from enough and fear

 Lunar New Year a also known as Chinese New Year a this week,  mostly via trains, planes, roads, and ferries , both domestically and internationally. The first day of the new year is on Saturday.   Lunar New Year travels have been described as the alargest annual

temperatures at the busy Beijing West railway station, and only half of 
the people there were wearing face masks,  Reuters reported .   Just having thermal scanners isnat enough, either. Professor Allen 
Cheng, an infectious-diseases physician at Australiaas Monash 
University, said: aEvidence suggests that entry screening (e.g. thermal 
scanners) arenat very effective at identifying people with new viruses.   aThis is because border screening isnat very sensitive (people with

arenat specific (most people with a fever will have another infection,

1418010694,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/australia/fires-size-climate.html,2020-01-21,Why These Australia Fires Are Like Nothing We've Seen Before," SYDNEY,
 Australia a In late October, lightning struck brittle earth on Gospers 
Mountain in New South Wales. The remains of trees bone dry from 
consecutive winters with little to no rain were ignited, and the fire 
quickly spread.   Three months later, it is still burning.   The
 Gospers Mountain fire, which became Australiaas largest amegablazea as 
it grew to link several separate fires, offers a sense of the scale of 
the countryas most disastrous fire season ever. The blaze has burned two
 million acres, enveloping hinterland and wine country, and prompted a 
special mission to save  prehistoric trees  so rare that their exact location is kept secret.   That
 fire is now largely contained. But dozens of others are still burning 
in the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, some out of 
control, despite heavy rain in some areas in recent days. And fire 
season is far from over a hot and windy conditions are expected to 
return this week, and a month of summer remains. Here is a look at the 
devastation.         The modern world has never seen anything quite like these Australia fires.    About 16 million acres have burned 
 in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis is centered. Thatas 
an area about the size of West Virginia. Millions more acres have burned
 in other parts of the country.   What sets these blazes apart, in 
terms of their size, is that they are happening in populated areas. 
Until now, fires this large happened mostly in places like northern 
Canada or  Siberia , where few people live and blazes burn largely uncontrolled.   aWhat
 weare seeing in Australia, in a completely different environment, are 
fires that are approaching or even exceeding the magnitude of things 
that we only saw in the most remote forested regions in the world,a said
 Ross Bradstock, the director of the Center for Environmental Risk 
Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong in New South 
Wales.   aWeare looking at a globally significant fire season in Australia,a he added.   The numbers from Australia dwarf those from some of the most high-profile fires in recent years.   The
 bushfires in southeastern Australia this season have burned about eight
 times as much land as the 2018 fires in California, which covered 
nearly two million acres and were the worst in that stateas recorded 
history. They are also far larger than the  estimates of 2.2 million acres 
 burned by September last year in the Amazon basin, where farmers, some 
emboldened by the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, 
ignited tens of thousands of fires to clear land.   aItas
 quite phenomenal and far exceeds anything you would see in the western 
U.S.A., which is a very fire-prone area, the southwest of Canada, the 
Mediterranean and parts of South America,a Dr. Bradstock said. aItas so 
much bigger than anything else.a   Australia
 has had deadlier fire seasons: The Black Saturday bushfires, which 
began in February 2009 when downed power lines ignited blazes that were 
spread by 60-mile-per-hour winds, killed 173 people in Victoria. The 
2018 California fires killed 103 people.   But the losses Australia 
is experiencing in lives and property are still staggering, and not yet 
over. At least 29 people have been killed. Hundreds of millions of 
animals, by some estimates, have perished or are facing starvation or 
dehydration in devastated habitats. And more than 2,500 homes have been 
destroyed.   Smoke generated by the fires has blanketed Sydney, 
Melbourne and Canberra, at times giving them some of the worst air in 
the world. The prolonged exposure of bushfire smoke to millions of 
people has raised  fears of health effects  that could last for years.   Early
 this month, NASA began tracking a plume of smoke from the fires that 
was the size of the continental United States. By Jan. 14, smoke  had circumnavigated the globe ,
 returning to eastern Australia. Along the way, it caused hazardous 
breathing conditions in New Zealand and discolored skies in South 
America.   The fires have also produced  huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon emissions .
 A top expert on greenhouse gas emissions at Australiaas national 
research agency told NPR that the fires in southeastern Australia had 
produced as much carbon as the entire country emits from man-made 
sources in more than eight months of the year.         Why
 have these fires been so vast? While Australia is normally hot and dry 
in the summer, climate change is bringing longer and more frequent 
periods of extreme heat. That makes vegetation drier and more likely to 
burn.   Last year was the hottest and driest year on record in 
Australia, and some regions have been gripped by drought for years. This
 season, the fires started earlier than usual a some as soon as July a 
and they are expected to last well into February and even March.   High
 temperatures, strong winds and dry forests have combined to create the 
conditions for powerful fires. There have even been blazes in wetlands 
and rainforests that have not contended with this threat before. To 
combat the flames,  tens of thousands of firefighters, most of them volunteers , have been called on to work long days over extended periods.   Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have  misleadingly pointed to arson 
 in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian
 governmentas inaction on the issue. Others have argued that the drought
 is unrelated to climate change, though there is evidence that warming 
temperatures have been a major contributor to it, in part by pushing 
rain out of areas where it once fell.   aThe wildfires decimating 
Australia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing 
communities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and 
coalescing into the countryas worst peacetime catastrophe precisely 
because of climate change,a said Paul Read, a co-director of the 
National Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University 
in Melbourne.   In Australiaas history, most bad fire seasons have coincided with the warming of an El NiA+-o pattern. But  that is not the case this time ,
 showing how much this season stands out and the danger the country 
faces with more unpredictable weather patterns in the future.   While
 scientists have long predicted that climate change would bring longer 
and more intense fire seasons, the blazes were not expected to be this 
bad this soon, Dr. Bradstock said. Under his projections, Australia 
would not have seen this kind of devastation for another 40 to 50 years,
 he said.   aI guess Iam as shocked as anyone about whatas unfolding
 and, probably, like everyone else whoas involved and affected, weall 
very quickly recalibrate thinking about what weare doing,a he said.   Recalibrating
 means expecting these phenomenal fires to continue to occur, 
particularly as Australiaas drought shows few signs of ending and 
temperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade 
on record.   aWe would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence 
and the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off 
phenomenon,a Dr. Bradstock said. aI think we have to get ready to deal 
with a season like this again in the not-too-distant future.a  "

 drug used to treat anxiety can slow the spread of cancer by blocking 
stress, according to a study by an Australian university.    Beta-blockers,
 a common pill taken to reduce blood pressure, could lead to a reduction
 in the number deaths from breast cancer by stopping cancer cells from 
spreading through the body.   According to researchers, the 
expansion of cancer is a key factor in the deaths of breast cancer 
sufferers. An estimated 3,000 Australian women died from breast cancer 
in 2019.    Beta-blockers, a common pill taken to reduce
 blood pressure, could lead to a reduction in the number deaths from 
breast cancer by stopping cancer cells from spreading through the body 
(stock image)   A study by Melbourne's Monash University could
 bring hope to the 20,000 Australians diagnosed with the condition each 
year, as beta-blockers were found to stop cancer cells spreading through
 the body in women with breast cancer.   The trial analysed 64 women
 who were in the early stages of their breast cancer diagnosis and it 
ran from the time of diagnosis until after the breast cancer surgery.   Half
 of the participants were given propranolol - a beta-blocker 
used to treat cardiac disease and anxiety disorders - while the 
remainder were given a placebo.    Associate Professor Erica 
Sloan started the study in 2016 with Dr Jonathan Hiller and along with 
teams from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.    'We know that 
stress activates the ''fight-or-flight'' response and, for patients with
 cancer, the time from diagnosis to surgery can be both stressful and 
emotional,' Dr Sloan said.   'Our research discovered that the ''fight-or-flight response'' can increase metastasis, helping cancer spread through the body.   'We
 harnessed that knowledge by repurposing existing drugs. Our goal was to
 see if we could stop cancer cells spreading in the body. We found that 
beta-blockers a which halt the stress response a stopped the cancer 
invading.'   The researchers found that just one week of beta-blockers therapy inhibited cancer invasion.    'This
 study showed how reducing the stress response supports patients during 
cancer diagnosis and treatment, which is a very stressful time.' Dr 
Hiller said.   'These findings allow us to think about how we can 
use beta-blockers at the same time as existing cancer treatments such as
 chemotherapy, to improve survival rates for patients with cancer.'   A
 study by Melbourne's Monash University could bring hope to the 20,000 
Australians diagnosed with the condition each year, as beta-blockers

The National Centre of Meteorology, NCM, today welcomed a delegation 
comprising several leading international and national experts, 
researchers, scientists and stakeholders at the Emirates  Weather  Enhancement Factory.    The delegation attended the 4th International Rain Enhancement Forum, organised by the  UAE  Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science under the NCMas supervision  from  19th-21st  January   2020 .    The delegation was received by Dr. Abdulla Al Mandous, Director of NCM and President of the Regional Association II ( Asia ) of the  World  Meteorological Organisation, WMO, along with senior officials  from  the centre.    The group comprised Dr. Nawal Al-Hosany, Permanent Representative of the  UAE  to IRENA; Dr. Deon Terblanche,  Weather  and Climate  consultant  at  World Bank 
 and former Director of Research at the WMO; Prof. Roelof Bruintjes, a 
senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research; Dr. 
Steve Griffiths, Senior Vice President for Research and Development at 
Khalifa University, and Dr. Lulin Xue, UAEREPas third cycle awardee, 
Chief Scientist at Hua Xin Chuang Zhi Science and  Technology  LLC and a member of the  Beijing   Weather  Modification Office advisory panel.    It
 also included Richard Behnke, President at SciencePrime; Dr. Robert 
Robinson, Chief Scientist at SciencePrime; Prof. Taha Ourada, Professor 
and Chairman,  Canada  Research Chair in Statistical Hydro-Climatology at National Institute of Scientific Research; Prof. Steve Siems, Professor at  school  of Earth Atmosphere and Environment, Monash University; Dr.     Gary  Thunen, Chief Scientist and Senior Fellow, Advanced  Technology

During the  visit , the delegation learned about the objectives of the-state-of-the-art facility that specialises in the manufacturing of various  weather  modification products in the  UAE , and its plans to conduct innovative research projects in  weather  modification and rain enhancement.    The
 factory has developed several samples of specially-designed dispensers 
to carry innovative nanomaterials as part of one of the programmeas 
first cycle awardee project. Developed in collaboration with the 
Research, Development and Training department at the NCM, these 
materials will be sprayed into clouds without altering their physical 
and chemical characteristics using the centreas custom-designed 
aircraft.    The materials have a high condensation capability at 
relatively low levels of humidity compared to other materials, and their
 design prevents the clotting of the materials during the process. The 
dispensers underwent a series of ground field tests at a specially 
designed facility within the Emirates  Weather  Enhancement Factory before being loaded into the aircraft, to determine the most suitable designs.    Nanomaterials can accelerate  water  condensation and droplet formation inside the clouds. This  results  in larger sizes of  water  droplets during rainfall, amounting to up to triple times the old method as proven by laboratory experiments and cloud  chamber  tests to simulate cloud development.

 Canberra bushfire has been brought within containment lines after it 
sparked an emergency warning and fuelled a dangerous black smoke plume.   The
 Kallaroo Road and Redwood Forest fires in the northern suburb of 
Piallago merged to create the Beard fire, spanning 424 hectares on 
Thursday afternoon.   The fire is burning within containment lines and has been downgraded from an emergency warning to watch and act level.   Canberra's
 airport has reopened with Qantas operating a limited service, but 
Virgin, Tiger and Singapore Airlines cancelled flights for the rest of 
the day.   ACT Fire and Rescue Chief Officer Mark Brown said 
firefighters and water-bombing helicopters would continue to work on the
 fire into the evening.   ""It's burning well within containment 
lines and we have a large number of crews actively patrolling that 
fire,"" he told reporters.   A fire is burning at a recycling centre
 in Beard which earlier produced dangerous levels of thick, black smoke 
which will reduced visibility and air quality.   Mr Brown said the situation had improved at the recycling plant.   ""The smoke plume has reduced significantly and firefighters will continue to work on that fire for the next few days,"" he said.   People in Beard, Harman, Oaks Estate and Crestwood are being told to stay inside to avoid the dangerous smoke.   People in Pialligo and Brindabella Business Park, near the airport, have been advised to stay up to date and monitor conditions.   There are unconfirmed reports of building damage, the ACT Emergency Services Agency said.   The

provider had an outage affecting sites across southeast Australia.   Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the issues leading to the website failure would be reviewed after the fires.   ""Undoubtedly, we would want greater reliability for such an essential communication tool,"" he said.   ACT
 Rural Fire Service chief officer Joe Murphy said predicted cooler, 
calmer condition on Friday would help crews control the fire.   ""The winds are abating and will be much lower tomorrow,"" he said.   Friday will not be a total fire ban.   Earlier, the ESA reported a firefighter had suffered minor injuries before being treated and continuing to fight the fire.   The blaze started on Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures saw conditions in Canberra deteriorate.   Canberra's state of alert will continue through to the end of the Australia Day long weekend.   ""We
 look forward to conditions easing somewhat, but clearly we will remain 
on alert through the next 24 hours and over the long weekend,"" Mr Barr 
said.     Advertisement    "

important to recognise symptoms of the illness.   Professor Cheng explained: aAlmost all cases have reported fever and respiratory symptoms.   aA proportion of cases have been critically unwell, requiring hospitalisation with organ failure.   aIt
 is always difficult to determine early in an outbreak how severe the

1421137787,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-painful-is-labor,2020-01-23,How painful is labor and how you might reduce the pain," Having a child can be a labor of love, literally. And everyone will 
experience it differently. Here's what to expect if it's your first time
 giving birth.    The first stage of labor is when you start feeling regular contractions until you are 10 cm dilated. It can last anywhere from  a couple of hours to a few days.  But it's the second stage of labor when you can expect the most pain.   The second stage of labor encompasses that time that your spending pushing at 10 cm until the baby is delivered. The  pain  may intensify as contractions increase in frequency and the baby starts to crown.    According to  Euan Wallace ,
 the former director of obstetrics services at Monash Health in 
Australia, the second stage is where severe cramping or a gripping 
sensation in the abdomen may come in. Wallace says many women complain 
of back pain during the second stage, which could indicate the way the 
baby is positioned a babies facing up tend to cause  more severe back pain.     On
 a scale of one to ten, Wallace says some women describe labor pain as a
 minimum two or three, while others feel it as a ten. The pain from 
contractions comes and goes with brief periods of relief.     The mother's position during labor 
 also matters. Squatting may reduce labor pain and shorten the second 
stage of labor. Sitting positions are associated with less labor pain 
and shortened second stage of labor, but increased blood loss and 
obstetric anal sphincter injury.    The  second stage of labor  is the most physically active for your body. According to a  2011 study ,
 your heart rate can go up to nearly 200 beats per minute. ""[It's] 
easily equivalent to an elite athlete's most intense workout,"" Wallace 
says.    Once you're done giving birth, the pain should subside but expect to be sore, particularly in the  back, stomach, and pelvic muscles . Lacerations and incision sites could also hurt, such as vaginal lacerations tears or  episiotomy ,
 which is an incision made on the vaginal opening to widen it and help 
the baby get out. Vaginal lacerations will typically heal 4 to 6 weeks 
after delivery.   "

1422279092,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7926015/Twisty-touchscreen-rolled-like-tube.html,2020-01-24,'Twisty' touchscreen is so thin it can be rolled out like a tube ," Scientists
 have created an ultra-thin flexible electronic material for 
'touchscreens of the future' that can be rolled into a tube and printed 
like newspaper.   Australian researchers developed the material out 
of indium tin oxide and used a liquid metal printing technique to turn 
it into a two-dimensional film.   The touch-responsive material is 
100 times thinner than existing touchscreen materials used in 
smartphones and tablets and is so pliable that it can be rolled up like a
 tube.   Smartphone makers like Samsung and Motorola have recently 
released their own curvy displays that can bend without breaking, but 
the RMIT team says its version even twists.   The team has developed
 a working prototype touchscreen from the material and has applied for a
 patent to commercialise the technology.   A sample of the 
ultra-thin and ultra-flexible electronic material that could be printed 
and rolled out like newspaper, for the touchscreens of the future   'We've
 taken an old material and transformed it from the inside to create a 
new version that's supremely thin and flexible,' said lead researcher Dr
 Torben Daeneke, at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia.   'You can bend 
it, you can twist it, and you could make it far more cheaply and 
efficiently that the slow and expensive way that we currently 
manufacture touchscreens.'   The nano-thin sheets are highly conductive and two dimensional a with a thickness of about 1.4 nanometres.   This equates to about 10 to 15 atoms, or about a billionth of a metre.    'Turning it two-dimensional also makes it more transparent, so it lets through more light,' said Dr Daeneke.   To
 create the new conductive sheet, an RMIT University-led team used a 
thin film common in cell phone touchscreens and shrunk it from 3D to 2D,
 using 'liquid metal chemistry'   'This means a cell phone 
with a touchscreen made of our material would use less power, extending 
the battery life by roughly 10 per cent.'   The current methods of 
manufacturing transparent films for standard touchscreens is a slow, 
energy-intensive and expensive process, conducted in a vacuum chamber to
 remove the surrounding air.   'The beauty is that our approach 
doesn't require expensive or specialised equipment a it could even be 
done in a home kitchen,' Dr Daeneke said.    The nano-thin 
sheet is readily compatible with existing electronic technologies and, 
because of its high flexibility, could be manufactured through 
roll-to-roll (R2R) processing much like newspaper.    The
 research team that created the new material, from left to right, Dr 
Robi Datta, Dr Torben Daeneke and Dr Nitu Syed at RMIT, Melbourne, 
Australia   Indium tin oxide (ITO), a colourless 'ternary' compound, is itself made out of three compounds a indium, tin and oxygen.   It has a high eclectic conductivity and transparency in a range of colours.    Most smartphone touchscreens are made of ITO, which is very conductive but also, in its 3D form, rather brittle.     To
 create the new type of atomically thin ITO, the researchers started by 
heating an indium-tin alloy to 392AdegF (200AdegC) at which point it becomes 
liquid ITO.    This was then rolled over a surface to print off nano-thin sheets of indium tin oxide.   These
 2D sheets have the same chemical make-up as standard ITO but a 
different crystal structure, giving them new mechanical and optical 
properties.   The new ITO absorbs just 0.7 per cent of light compared to the 5 to 10 per cent of standard conductive glass.    This
 means more than 99 per cent would be reflected back at the smartphone 
user's line of vision for a clearer, crisper display.    'There's
 no other way of making this fully flexible, conductive and transparent 
material aside from our new liquid metal method,' said Dr Daeneke.   'It was impossible up to now a people just assumed that it couldn't be done.'   The
 material could also be used in many other opto-electronic applications,
 such as LEDs and other touch displays, as well as cells for 
solar-powered devices and smart windows.   'We're excited to be at 
the stage now where we can explore commercial collaboration 
opportunities and work with the relevant industries to bring this 
technology to market,' Daeneke said.   The research team, which is 
made up of scientists from UNSW, Monash University and ARC Centre of 
Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics, have published their method
 in  Nature Electronics .   On

 year, which folds down a central hinge within the screen.   The phone was beleaguered by technical hitches in the run-up to its worldwide launch, however.   Motorola's foldable revamp of its iconic Razr phone is also now available to pre-order in the UK.    But the technology isn't cheap a the phones cost Britons APS1,800 and a whopping APS2,356 respectively.    "

 and can be rolled away, like in the films Minority Report 
and Harry Potter, are on the horizon after a breakthrough by 
scientists.   In the 2002 Steven Spielberg Movie, Tom Cruise is forced to make a 
speedy getaway when his face appears on the front page of a futuristic 
e-paper being read by a commuter.   Likewise moving newspapers have also featured in Harry Potter, but 
until now scientists did not think touchscreens would ever be small 
enough to make the idea a reality.   Now material scientists at  Monash University 
 in Melbourne have developed an ultra-thin and ultra-flexible electronic
 material that is 100 times thinner than existing touchscreens and can 
be rolled up.    T he nano-thin sheets could be manufactured through

 scramble to contact passengers who shared flights from China with the 
patients.   Three men in New South Wales, aged 43, 53 and 35, 
and one in Victoria have caught the deadly disease which originated in 
Wuhan ad has killed 41 around the world.   The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne  on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19.    He
 became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia on 
Saturday morning and is now in quarantined isolation at Monash
 Hospital in Clayton in Melbourne's east.   The Sydney patients are being treated at Westmead Hospital, NSW Health confirmed on Saturday night.    None of the men is in a serious condition. They are in hospital simply to stop the virus spreading.    Two
 had flown from Wuhan while the other arrived in Sydney from Shenzhen, 
south China, officials revealed as they urged anyone with symptoms who 
has been to China recently to come forward.    Earlier on Saturday a baby was rushed from Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared of the virus.   The
 federal government has stepped up measures to protect Australians from 
the the deadly coronavirus virus after the first case in Australia 
was confirmed (stock image)   The deadly virus has already claimed 41 lives in China and is expected to rise worldwide    Five people tested in Queensland since have been cleared.   Another
 four people in South Australia are undergoing tests as a precaution but
 the likelihood of having the virus is low, according to authorities.   Officials
 expect more people will be struck down with the dangerous virus in 
coming weeks as it threatens to become a global pandemic.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison released a statement on Saturday afternoon 
saying officials are now tracking down all passengers who took the same 
flight as the man infected in Melbourne.   The A380 plane, which can can carry 500, arrived at Melbourne's Tullaramine Airport around 9.25am on January 19.    Mr
 Morrison also announced the federal government has stepped up measures 
to protect Australians from the virus, along with a dire warning to not 
travel to China's Wuhan or Hubei provinces.    'From today 
(Saturday), anyone arriving in Australia on flights from other parts of 
China will be met and provided instruction on what to do it they have 
symptoms it start to develop them,' Mr Morrison's statement read.    'Chinese authorities have also imposed travel restriction sin at least five cities in the Hubei province.   'Australians travelling to these areas may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.   Mr
 Morrison added the federal government will continue to monitor the 
situation and take action when necessary.       In
 Melbourne, many CBD pharmacies are running out of protective face 
masks, which were already in huge demand due to the toxic haze from the 
state's bushfires that have blanketed the city in t recent weeks.   'I
 have been to nine pharmacies already, they're all out of them,' a Royal
 Melbourne Institute of Technology student originally from Shanghai told
 Reuters.   'And I need them, we all need them.'    The dangerous coronavirus has spread to 11 countries as the number of cases grows   Fourteen
 cities across the Hubei province in China are restricting the movement 
of people a by reducing or cancelling public transport and closing roads
 a to try and stop the virus spreading   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      However, health officials say the masks are not recommended.   'Face
 masks are not recommended for use by members of the public in Victoria 
for the prevention of infections like novel coronavirus,' the Victoria 
health department said in a statement.   Victoria Health Minister 
Jenny Mikakos told reporters on Saturday that the infected patient had 
been in Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - for two weeks by 
himself.    'He was confirmed as positive after a series of tests early this morning,' Ms Mikakos said on Saturday.    Ms
 Mikakos said it was 'possible' the man wasn't contagious while on board
 as he didn't start showing symptoms until after arriving in 
Melbourne.    'We are now in the process of making contact with all the other passengers [on the flight],' she said.    'It is important to stress that there is no cause for alarm to the community.   In
 Queensland six people - including three from the Gold Coast - were 
being assessed for the virus, five of whom have now been given the 
all-clear.    Four others in Queensland were given an all-clear earlier in the week.     Three confirmed victims in NSW are now being treated in isolation in NSW hospitals   A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first 
Australian case of coronavirus   China's
 status as a major superpower may have influenced the World Health 
Organisation's decision not to declare coronavirus an international 
emergency, experts have warned.    More than 1,300 people have 
been infected globally with the virus traced to a seafood market in the 
central city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.   Despite
 this, the WHO has failed to declare a global health crisis. On Thursday
 the organisation said it was 'too early' for such a decision but added 
an emergency could still be declared if the outbreak continues to 
spread.    'This should not be taken as a sign that we don't 
think the outbreak is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously,' 
said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.    'Nothing could be further from the truth.'    Now, baffled experts have warned that their decision may have been influenced by China.    Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told  The Daily Telegraph : 'The criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern have been met.'    But 'not all WHO decisions are made based on the developments in the biological world,' he added.   A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear.    NSW
 chief health officer Kerry Chant said two men with the virus in Sydney 
were not particularly unwell but were being kept in isolation at 
Sydney's Westmead Hospital.     Two travelled to Sydney from Wuhan and the third from China's southeastern Shenzhen.   NSW
 Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant confirmed one man arrived in Australia
 on January 6, another arrived 13 days later and she was yet to confirm 
travel details for the third man.    'As far as I know, they were not on the same flight,' Dr Chant said.     'The risk of transmission is still very, very low. But we felt it was prudent to take this precautionary approach.'   They are two of six people being assessed in NSW, with two others cleared on Friday.    In Tasmania, a man in his 30s who travelled to Wuhan this month is being tested for the virus in Royal Hobart Hospital.   The
 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade overnight raised the level of 
travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei province to 'do not travel'.    The disease is listed as having 'pandemic potential', allowing border measures to be enhanced.   'The
 confirmation today by Victorian authorities of the coronavirus case was
 a matter that had been anticipated,' Mr Morrison said.    'The Australian government is of course taking this issue incredibly seriously.'    A pamphlet handed out by the Australian Government providing travellers with information on the deadly coronavirus (pictured)   Around a dozen cases  being investigated nationwide, according to Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young.   'It's an evolving number,' she told reporters on Saturday.   'We will be treating them as if they're confirmed cases, as a precaution.   'We still don't understand the transmissibility of this virus.   'If
 you develop fever, coughs or shortness of breath, you should ring ahead
 to your GP, discuss it and your GP will refer you to the emergency 
department.'   Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said
 it was important for people arriving from Wuhan - and those in close 
contact with them - to monitor for symptoms including fever, cough, sore
 throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing.   Experts are still learning about the virus.   'We
 don't know exactly how long symptoms take to show after a person has 
been infected but there is an incubation period and some patients will 
have very mild symptoms,' Prof Murphy said.   China has confirmed 41
 deaths from the virus, while more than 1,000 people are now estimated 
to have been affected worldwide. Cases have been confirmed in 10 
countries.   Patients with the novel coronavirus (pictured) 
typically have a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some patients 
have developed pneumonia   Wuhan is a city of 11 
million people which has been the epicentre of the outbreak. It is now 
treating dozens of patients (pictured)    'We're 
confident that outside the major epicentre of China there is not yet 
evidence of significant, or any, human to human spread,' Prof Murphy 
said.   Federal and state chief medical officers held joint discussions on Saturday with health ministers expected to do the same.   Prime
 Minister Morrison said the confirmation of a case in Australia had been
 anticipated and procedures are in place to manage the situation.   'I'd
 urge Australians to go about their day, go about their business in the 
knowledge that the professionals and the experts are there to provide 
the support that is needed in times like this are on the job and they're
 getting about it to keep you and your families safe,' he said.   The
 infected man in Melbourne has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, 
being treated in a negative pressure isolation room.    Deputy 
Chief Health Officer Dr Angie Bone said the man felt tired after landing
 in Melbourne, before he started feeling ill later that day.   He then presented himself to a doctor on Thursday, four days after arriving in Australia.   'My
 understanding is he came off the plane and felt very tired and spent 
the next day resting in his room, towards the end of the day he 
developed symptoms,' Dr Bone said.   There is said to be little risk
 of him spreading the deadly virus in Melbourne, as he spent the last 
week with family and hasn't visited any public places since being in 
Australia.   'He stayed in his room as he was conscious he may have 
caught the disease, so his family didn't allow anyone in his room,' Dr 
Bone said.    Medical staff work in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan (pictured) have been working round the clock   'He
 has not been out and about, so I guess that minimises the risk to the 
broader community and he has taken all the appropriate precautions in 
terms of calling ahead to the GP clinic and to the hospital before he 
has presented on both of those occasions.   'So, he has done everything right. The family has done everything right to minimise the risk.   'There
 is a possibility the family may have caught the infection, we will be 
observing them very closely. It will help us understand how easy it is 
to transmit this virus.'    Dr Bone said the man wasn't a health care worker and may well have picked up the disease in a public setting.   France
 has confirmed two coronavirus cases, the first in Europe. Despite 
prevention measures such as sanitation being done in South Korea 
(pictured), the virus continues to spread globally   'There's 
no evidence of human to human transmission here [in Australia]. It 
will be very hard to be specific about where people catch it from,' she 
said.       Transportation in Wuhan, the 
epicentre of the outbreak, and at least 12 nearby cities has been shut 
down, effectively placing 36 million people into lockdown.   So far 
more than 1320 people have been infected in China while France has had 
three people test positive - the disease's first appearance in Europe.   Two cases, including a Chicago woman returning from China, have been confirmed in the United States.     What is this virus?    The
 virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses 
are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory 
infections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be 
deadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a 
coronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the 
early 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 41 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.     What are the symptoms?    Its
 symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some 
patients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening 
infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. 
People carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such 
as a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek 
medical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The
 virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the 
rest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose 
potential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to 
disease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting 
infected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has
 an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because 
symptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries
 in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South
 Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia
 and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the 
UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts
 have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more 
than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere     "

 Instagram-famous bikie and convicted killer has claimed the Wuhan 
coronavirus sweeping across the world is 'Allah's revenge' for  China 's persecution of millions of Muslims.   Retired Nomads president Moudi Tajjour took to  Snapchat  saying Allah 'created' the killer virus which has killed 41 around the world and infected at least four in Australia.    'China
 has imprisoned more than one million Muslims in detention, so Allah 
sheds (sic) a virus that has not been discovered yet,' the 35-year-old 
wrote.   'It has isolated four cities with a population of more than 20 million Chinese.'   He then goes on to cite a verse from the Quran, 'And you are unaware of what they going to do.'   'Allah is great, never forgot this.' (sic)   United
 Nations experts and rights groups estimate more than a million Uighurs 
and members of other ethnic groups have been detained in camps in 
China's far western region of Xinjiang, which has triggered 
international condemnation.    Tajjour wrote on Snapchat that the killer Coronavirus was 'created' by Allah due to China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims   China says the camps are vocational training centres to impart new skills and help root out and prevent extremism.   Former detainees claimed that Muslims were forced to eat pork and speak Mandarin in the internment camps.    After
 initially denying their existence, China acknowledged that it had 
opened 'vocational education centres' in Xinjiang aimed at preventing 
extremism by teaching Mandarin and job skills.   Tajjour, who was 
jailed over the 2006 manslaughter of Robin Nassour, the younger brother 
of Fat Pizza star George, was the youngest ever member to join the 
Nomads' ranks in the late-1990s.   After leaving school in Year 8 he
 joined the outlaw motorcycle gang as a 'nominee', but had to wait 16 
months before becoming a fully fledged member.

Three patients in New South Wales and one in Victoria were on Saturday confirmed to have caught the deadly disease.   The
 patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to 
Melbourne on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on

 officials are trying to track down hundreds of passengers who shared 
flight with a man diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus.   The man arrived in Sydney from Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicentre of the escalating outbreak, on January 20.   He
 is the fourth person in Australia and the third in NSW to come down 
with the virus that has killed 41 people and infected more than 1,300.   The

was confirmed (stock image)   The 53-year-old arrived in 
Sydney on China Eastern Flight MU749, landing at 11.35am, and developed 
symptoms that night before seeing a doctor.   NSW Health is trying to find his fellow passengers to see if they could have been infected by coming into contact with him.   'We
 have asked the National Incident Room to pull the records for those 
people that were on the flight and we are getting the seat details,' NSW
 chief medical officer Kerry Chant said.    Three men in NSW, aged 43, 53 and 35, and one aged in his 50s in Victoria have caught the deadly disease.   None of the men is in a serious condition. They are in hospital simply to stop the virus spreading.    The deadly virus has already claimed 41 lives in China and is expected to rise worldwide    Two flew from Wuhan while the other arrived in Sydney from Shenzhen in southern China, just north of Hong Kong.   None of the men had symptoms on the flight so the likelihood that they infected fellow passengers is low.   'We do not believe that they were infectious at the time of their international flight,' Dr Chant said.     NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.    January 25     January 27     VICTORIA: 4     January 25     January 29      January 30       She is being treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital.         February 1        A Melbourne woman aged in her 20s is at home recovering.    She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later.    She was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested.    QUEENSLAND: 2      January 29      January 30       SOUTH AUSTRALIA   : 2     February 1       A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital.   The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   However,
 they may have come into contact with hundreds of people since getting 
off their planes and despite interviewing many people who met them, 
there would be many others at risk.   Officials urged anyone with symptoms who has been to China recently to come forward.   Dr Chant also asked GPs to contact NSW Health if they had a patient showing symptoms of coronavirus.   'Make
 sure you have processes in place and consider where people have 
travelled and particularly be conscious of people returning from China,'
 she said.    NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said anyone who comes forward with symptoms will have their privacy respected.   'They should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department,' he said.   'If the GP considers novel coronavirus testing is needed they will be referred to the emergency department for testing.'    The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne  on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers.       He
 became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia on 
Saturday morning and is now in quarantined isolation at Monash
 Hospital in Clayton in Melbourne's east.   The Sydney patients are being treated at Westmead Hospital, NSW Health confirmed on Saturday night.    Earlier on Saturday a baby was rushed from Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared of the virus.   Five people tested in Queensland since have been cleared.   The dangerous coronavirus has spread to 11 countries as the number of cases grows   Fourteen
 cities across the Hubei province in China are restricting the movement 
of people a by reducing or cancelling public transport and closing roads
 a to try and stop the virus spreading   Another four people 
in South Australia are undergoing tests as a precaution but the 
likelihood of having the virus is low, according to authorities.   Officials
 expect more people will be struck down with the dangerous virus in 
coming weeks as it threatens to become a global pandemic.     Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison said the federal government has stepped up
 measures to protect Australians from the virus, along with a dire 
warning to not travel to China's Wuhan or Hubei provinces.    'From
 today (Saturday), anyone arriving in Australia on flights from other 
parts of China will be met and provided instruction on what to do it 
they have symptoms it start to develop them,' he said.    'Chinese authorities have also imposed travel restriction sin at least five cities in the Hubei province.   'Australians travelling to these areas may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.   Mr
 Morrison added the federal government will continue to monitor the 
situation and take action when necessary.       In
 Melbourne, many CBD pharmacies are running out of protective face 
masks, which were already in huge demand due to the toxic haze from the 
state's bushfires that have blanketed the city in t recent weeks.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      'I
 have been to nine pharmacies already, they're all out of them,' a Royal
 Melbourne Institute of Technology student originally from Shanghai told
 Reuters.   'And I need them, we all need them.'    However, health officials say the masks are not recommended.   'Face
 masks are not recommended for use by members of the public in Victoria 
for the prevention of infections like novel coronavirus,' the Victoria 
health department said in a statement.   Victoria Health Minister 
Jenny Mikakos told reporters on Saturday that the infected patient had 
been in Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - for two weeks by 
himself.    'He was confirmed as positive after a series of tests early this morning,' Ms Mikakos said on Saturday.    Ms
 Mikakos said it was 'possible' the man wasn't contagious while on board
 as he didn't start showing symptoms until after arriving in 
Melbourne.    'We are now in the process of making contact with all the other passengers [on the flight],' she said.    'It is important to stress that there is no cause for alarm to the community.   In
 Queensland six people - including three from the Gold Coast - were 
being assessed for the virus, five of whom have now been given the 
all-clear.    Four others in Queensland were given an all-clear earlier in the week.     Three confirmed victims in NSW are now being treated in isolation in NSW hospitals   A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first 
Australian case of coronavirus   China's
 status as a major superpower may have influenced the World Health 
Organisation's decision not to declare coronavirus an international 
emergency, experts have warned.    More than 1,300 people have 
been infected globally with the virus traced to a seafood market in the 
central city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.   Despite
 this, the WHO has failed to declare a global health crisis. On Thursday
 the organisation said it was 'too early' for such a decision but added 
an emergency could still be declared if the outbreak continues to 
spread.    'This should not be taken as a sign that we don't 
think the outbreak is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously,' 
said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.    'Nothing could be further from the truth.'    Now, baffled experts have warned that their decision may have been influenced by China.    Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told  The Daily Telegraph : 'The criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern have been met.'    But 'not all WHO decisions are made based on the developments in the biological world,' he added.   A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear.      In Tasmania, a man in his 30s who travelled to Wuhan this month is being tested for the virus in Royal Hobart Hospital.   The
 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade overnight raised the level of 
travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei province to 'do not travel'.    The disease is listed as having 'pandemic potential', allowing border measures to be enhanced.   'The
 confirmation today by Victorian authorities of the coronavirus case was
 a matter that had been anticipated,' Mr Morrison said.    'The Australian government is of course taking this issue incredibly seriously.'    About a dozen cases are being investigated nationwide, according to Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young.   'It's an evolving number,' she told reporters on Saturday.   'We
 will be treating them as if they're confirmed cases, as a precaution. 
We still don't understand the transmissibility of this virus.   'If 
you develop fever, coughs or shortness of breath, you should ring ahead 
to your GP, discuss it and your GP will refer you to the emergency 
department.'   Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said
 it was important for people arriving from Wuhan - and those in close 
contact with them - to monitor for symptoms including fever, cough, sore
 throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing.   A pamphlet handed out by the Australian Government providing travellers with information on the deadly coronavirus (pictured)   Patients
 with the novel coronavirus (pictured) typically have a fever, cough and
 trouble breathing, but some patients have developed pneumonia   'We
 don't know exactly how long symptoms take to show after a person has 
been infected but there is an incubation period and some patients will 
have very mild symptoms,' Prof Murphy said.   China has confirmed 41
 deaths from the virus, while more than 1,000 people are now estimated 
to have been affected worldwide. Cases have been confirmed in 10 
countries.   'We're confident that outside the major epicentre of 
China there is not yet evidence of significant, or any, human to human 
spread,' Prof Murphy said.   Federal and state chief medical officers held joint discussions on Saturday with health ministers expected to do the same.   Prime
 Minister Morrison said the confirmation of a case in Australia had been
 anticipated and procedures are in place to manage the situation.   'I'd
 urge Australians to go about their day, go about their business in the 
knowledge that the professionals and the experts are there to provide 
the support that is needed in times like this are on the job and they're
 getting about it to keep you and your families safe,' he said.   Wuhan
 is a city of 11 million people which has been the epicentre of the 
outbreak. It is now treating dozens of patients (pictured)    The
 infected man in Melbourne has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, 
being treated in a negative pressure isolation room.    Deputy 
Chief Health Officer Dr Angie Bone said the man felt tired after landing
 in Melbourne, before he started feeling ill later that day.   He then presented himself to a doctor on Thursday, four days after arriving in Australia.   'My
 understanding is he came off the plane and felt very tired and spent 
the next day resting in his room, towards the end of the day he 
developed symptoms,' Dr Bone said.   There is said to be little risk
 of him spreading the deadly virus in Melbourne, as he spent the last 
week with family and hasn't visited any public places since being in 
Australia.   'He stayed in his room as he was conscious he may have 
caught the disease, so his family didn't allow anyone in his room,' Dr 
Bone said.    'He has not been out and about, so I guess that 
minimises the risk to the broader community and he has taken all the 
appropriate precautions in terms of calling ahead to the GP clinic and 
to the hospital before he has presented on both of those occasions.   'So, he has done everything right. The family has done everything right to minimise the risk.   'There
 is a possibility the family may have caught the infection, we will be 
observing them very closely. It will help us understand how easy it is 
to transmit this virus.'    Medical staff work in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan (pictured) have been working round the clock   Dr Bone said the man wasn't a health care worker and may well have picked up the disease in a public setting.   'There's
 no evidence of human to human transmission here [in Australia]. It
 will be very hard to be specific about where people catch it from,' she
 said.       Two cases, including a Chicago woman returning from China, have been confirmed in the United States.    The
 virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan, already on lockdown and where the 
virus is thought to have originated, banned most vehicle use downtown 
and Hong Kong said it would close schools for two weeks as authorities 
scramble to stop the spread of an illness that has infected more than 
1,400 people worldwide and killed 42.    France has 
confirmed two coronavirus cases, the first in Europe. Despite prevention
 measures such as sanitation being done in South Korea (pictured), the 
virus continues to spread globally   Chinese President Xi 
Jinping spoke following an emergency government meeting to warn that the
 spread of the killer virus is worsening, as video emerged showing 
medics collapsing at hospitals in the capital of central China's Hubei 
province as the coronavirus outbreak continues to move across the world.   As
 of 8 pm local time (1200 GMT) on Saturday, the death toll in China had 
risen to 42, authorities reported. Some 1,372 people in China had been 
infected with the virus - traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was 
illegally selling wildlife.   The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States.   
 'Faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread of the new 
coronavirus [...] it is necessary to strengthen the centralised and 
unified leadership of the Party Central Committee,' Xi said, according 
to official news agency Xinhua.   It comes as Liang Wudong, 62,
 who had been treating patients in Wuhan, died from the virus this 
morning, state-run China Global Television Network reported.   Wudong,
 who was retired but drafted in to help with the outbreak, died after 
time spent treating patients. It was also reported that another 
doctor, Jiang Jijun, has died from a heart attack while treating 
the afflicted.    It is unknown if the infectious disease 
specialist, who has treated bird flu and influenza A and tuberculosis 
over the years, died as a result of coronavirus or from 
exhaustion.     And the US, which has around 1,000 
citizens in the city, is set to evacuate those it knows about - 
including diplomats - on a 230 seater charter flight tomorrow.    The
 US government won approval for the operation from China's Foreign 
Ministry and other government agencies following negotiations in recent 
days,  The Wall Street Journal  reports. The British Foreign Ministry is yet to confirm whether it will do the same.   Also
 today, distressing video has emerged showing a doctor collapsing on the
 floor as footage revealed the full scale of panic inside Wuhan 
hospitals, with crowded corridors and patients slumped on the floor.   Video
 shows staff shouting at patients to calm themselves as medics 
desperately try to contain the situation. Some workers are reported to 
be wearing diapers as they don't have time to use the toilet amid the 
panic.   Some 56 million people are now subject to restrictions on 
their movement as authorities expand travel bans in central Hubei 
province, now affecting 18 cities.       What is this virus?    The

 she said.    NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said anyone who comes forward with symptoms will have their privacy respected.   'They should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department,' he said.   'If the GP considers novel coronavirus testing is needed they will be referred to the emergency department for testing.'    The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne  on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers.    He
 became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia on 
Saturday morning and is now in quarantined isolation at Monash
 Hospital in Clayton in Melbourne's east.   The Sydney patients are being treated at Westmead Hospital, NSW Health confirmed on Saturday night.    Earlier on Saturday a baby was rushed from Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared of the virus.   Five people tested in Queensland since have been cleared.   The dangerous coronavirus has spread to 11 countries as the number of cases grows   Fourteen
 cities across the Hubei province in China are restricting the movement 
of people a by reducing or cancelling public transport and closing roads
 a to try and stop the virus spreading   Another four people 
in South Australia are undergoing tests as a precaution but the 
likelihood of having the virus is low, according to authorities.   Officials
 expect more people will be struck down with the dangerous virus in 
coming weeks as it threatens to become a global pandemic.     Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison said the federal government has stepped up
 measures to protect Australians from the virus, along with giving a 
dire warning to not travel to China's Wuhan or Hubei provinces.    'From
 today (Saturday), anyone arriving in Australia on flights from other 
parts of China will be met and provided instruction on what to do it 
they have symptoms it start to develop them,' he said.    'Chinese authorities have also imposed travel restriction sin at least five cities in the Hubei province.   'Australians travelling to these areas may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      Mr
 Morrison added the federal government will continue to monitor the 
situation and take action when necessary.        Victoria
 Health Minister Jenny Mikakos told reporters on Saturday the infected 
patient had been in Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - for two 
weeks by himself.    'He was confirmed as positive after a series of tests early this morning,' Ms Mikakos said on Saturday.    Ms
 Mikakos said it was 'possible' the man wasn't contagious while on board
 as he didn't start showing symptoms until after arriving in 
Melbourne.    'We are now in the process of making contact with all the other passengers [on the flight],' she said.    'It is important to stress that there is no cause for alarm to the community.   In
 Queensland six people - including three from the Gold Coast - were 
being assessed for the virus, five of whom have now been given the 
all-clear.    Four others in Queensland were given an all-clear earlier in the week.     Three confirmed victims in NSW are now being treated in isolation in NSW hospitals   A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first 
Australian case of coronavirus   A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear.     In Tasmania, a man in his 30s who travelled to Wuhan this month is being tested for the virus in Royal Hobart Hospital.   China's
 status as a major superpower may have influenced the World Health 
Organisation's decision not to declare coronavirus an international 
emergency, experts have warned.    More than 1,300 people have 
been infected globally with the virus traced to a seafood market in the 
central city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.   Despite
 this, the WHO has failed to declare a global health crisis. On Thursday
 the organisation said it was 'too early' for such a decision but added 
an emergency could still be declared if the outbreak continues to 
spread.    'This should not be taken as a sign that we don't 
think the outbreak is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously,' 
said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.    'Nothing could be further from the truth.'    Now, baffled experts have warned that their decision may have been influenced by China.    Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told  The Daily Telegraph : 'The criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern have been met.'    But 'not all WHO decisions are made based on the developments in the biological world,' he added.   The
 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade overnight raised the level of 
travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei province to 'do not travel'.    The disease is listed as having 'pandemic potential', allowing border measures to be enhanced.   'The
 confirmation today by Victorian authorities of the coronavirus case was
 a matter that had been anticipated,' Mr Morrison said.    'The Australian government is of course taking this issue incredibly seriously.'    About a dozen cases are being investigated nationwide, according to Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young.   'It's an evolving number,' she told reporters on Saturday.   'We
 will be treating them as if they're confirmed cases, as a precaution. 
We still don't understand the transmissibility of this virus.   'If 
you develop fever, coughs or shortness of breath, you should ring ahead 
to your GP, discuss it and your GP will refer you to the emergency 
department.'   Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said
 it was important for people arriving from Wuhan - and those in close 
contact with them - to monitor for symptoms including fever, cough, sore
 throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing.   'We don't know exactly
 how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected but 
there is an incubation period and some patients will have very mild 
symptoms,' Prof Murphy said.     56 lives have been lost to the virus in China, and 1,975 people have been infected nationally.    'We're
 confident that outside the major epicentre of China there is not yet 
evidence of significant, or any, human to human spread,' Prof Murphy 
said.   A pamphlet handed out by the Australian Government providing travellers with information on the deadly coronavirus (pictured)   Federal and state chief medical officers held joint discussions on Saturday with health ministers expected to do the same.   Prime
 Minister Morrison said the confirmation of a case in Australia had been
 anticipated and procedures are in place to manage the situation.   'I'd
 urge Australians to go about their day, go about their business in the 
knowledge that the professionals and the experts are there to provide 
the support that is needed in times like this are on the job and they're
 getting about it to keep you and your families safe,' he said.   The
 infected man in Melbourne has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, 
being treated in a negative pressure isolation room.    Deputy 
Chief Health Officer Dr Angie Bone said the man felt tired after landing
 in Melbourne, before he started feeling ill later that day.   He then presented himself to a doctor on Thursday, four days after arriving in Australia.   'My
 understanding is he came off the plane and felt very tired and spent 
the next day resting in his room, towards the end of the day he 
developed symptoms,' Dr Bone said.   Patients with the novel 
coronavirus (pictured) typically have a fever, cough and trouble 
breathing, but some patients have developed pneumonia   There 
is said to be little risk of him spreading the deadly virus in 
Melbourne, as he spent the last week with family and hasn't visited any 
public places since being in Australia.   'He stayed in his room as 
he was conscious he may have caught the disease, so his family didn't 
allow anyone in his room,' Dr Bone said.    'He has not been 
out and about, so I guess that minimises the risk to the broader 
community and he has taken all the appropriate precautions in terms of 
calling ahead to the GP clinic and to the hospital before he has 
presented on both of those occasions.   'So, he has done everything right. The family has done everything right to minimise the risk.   'There
 is a possibility the family may have caught the infection, we will be 
observing them very closely. It will help us understand how easy it is 
to transmit this virus.'    Dr Bone said the man wasn't a health care worker and may well have picked up the disease in a public setting.   'There's
 no evidence of human to human transmission here [in Australia]. It
 will be very hard to be specific about where people catch it from,' she
 said.       Two cases, including a Chicago woman returning from China, have been confirmed in the United States.    Wuhan
 is a city of 11 million people which has been the epicentre of the 
outbreak. It is now treating dozens of patients (pictured)    The
 virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan, already on lockdown and where the 
virus is thought to have originated, banned most vehicle use downtown 
and Hong Kong said it would close schools for two weeks as authorities 
scramble to stop the spread of an illness that has infected more than 
1,400 people worldwide and killed 56.    Chinese President Xi 
Jinping spoke following an emergency government meeting to warn that the
 spread of the killer virus is worsening, as video emerged showing 
medics collapsing at hospitals in the capital of central China's Hubei 
province as the coronavirus outbreak continues to move across the 
world.    The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States.   
 'Faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread of the new 
coronavirus [...] it is necessary to strengthen the centralised and 
unified leadership of the Party Central Committee,' Xi said, according 
to official news agency Xinhua.   Medical staff work in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan (pictured) have been working round the clock   It
 comes as Liang Wudong, 62, who had been treating patients in 
Wuhan, died from the virus this morning, state-run China Global 
Television Network reported.   Wudong, who was retired but drafted 
in to help with the outbreak, died after time spent treating patients. 
It was also reported that another doctor, Jiang Jijun, has died 
from a heart attack while treating the afflicted.    It is 
unknown if the infectious disease specialist, who has treated bird flu 
and influenza A and tuberculosis over the years, died as a result of 
coronavirus or from exhaustion.     And the US, which has 
around 1,000 citizens in the city, is set to evacuate those it knows 
about - including diplomats - on a 230 seater charter flight 
tomorrow.    The US government won approval for the operation 
from China's Foreign Ministry and other government agencies following 
negotiations in recent days,  The Wall Street Journal  reports. The British Foreign Ministry is yet to confirm whether it will do the same.   France
 has confirmed two coronavirus cases, the first in Europe. Despite 
prevention measures such as sanitation being done in South Korea 
(pictured), the virus continues to spread globally   Also 
today, distressing video has emerged showing a doctor collapsing on the 
floor as footage revealed the full scale of panic inside Wuhan 
hospitals, with crowded corridors and patients slumped on the floor.   Video
 shows staff shouting at patients to calm themselves as medics 
desperately try to contain the situation. Some workers are reported to 
be wearing diapers as they don't have time to use the toilet amid the 
panic.   Some 56 million people are now subject to restrictions on 
their movement as authorities expand travel bans in central Hubei 
province, now affecting 18 cities.       What is this virus?    The
 virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses 
are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory 
infections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be 
deadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a 
coronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the 
early 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 56 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.     What are the symptoms?    Its
 symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some 
patients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening 
infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. 
People carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such 
as a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek 
medical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The
 virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the 
rest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose 
potential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to 
disease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting 
infected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has
 an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because 
symptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries
 in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South
 Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia
 and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the 
UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts
 have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more 
than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere     "

The 21-year-old woman tested positive to 'probable' coronavirus after initial swabs, with results to be confirmed on Monday.   'Public
 health follow-up of this probable case is being undertaken in 
accordance with the national guidelines and the patient remains in 
isolation,' NSW Health said on Sunday.    It comes after  three men in New South Wales, aged 43, 53 and 35, and one Victorian man aged in his 50s, caught the deadly disease .    The virus, which experts fear will 'highly likely' continue to spread in Australia, has so far killed 56 people in  China  and infected 2,000 people worldwide.   Since
 the outbreak at the end of December, Chinese authorities have placed 56
 million people in lockdown - including more than 100 Australian 
children aged between six months and 16 years old, the  ABC     reported.    Scroll down for video     A 21-year-old woman has been taken to hospital after fears she may have contracted the deadly coronavirus   The 21-year-old suspected of having the virus remains in isolation.   Photos

mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and 
clothing.   Authorities are contacting anyone who has come into contact with her.    Australia's Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said there would likely be more cases in the country.   'There is no cause for general concern,' Prof Murphy said in Melbourne on Sunday.   'I would not be surprised if there are some more cases... it's highly likely that we may see some more.   'We are incredibly well prepared to isolate and deal with that.'    Emma Wei, from Melbourne, is trapped in Wuhan with her two children amid China's lockdown   Medical staff are seen wearing protective clothing outside a hospital in Wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak    NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   In
 the wake of the rapid spread, Chinese-Australian parents are now 
desperate for their children to get out of Wuhan in China's Hubei 
province.   Yi Xu is demanding his six-month-old daughter be brought home to Australia.   'The
 Australian Government needs to follow what the US is doing [and] to 
charter a plane to evacuate its citizens for emergency,' Mr Xu told the 
ABC after reports the U.S was using a plane to evacuate Americans from 
the area.     A father from  Melbourne , Nathan Wang, said his 11-month-old daughter is stuck in Wuhan with his wife and other child.   Mr Wang said his family was struggling to access medical resources.    'I
 can't even fall asleep. As a father, I was very desperate. I am guilty 
that all of the risks and pressure were put on my wife alone,' he said.   Another Chinese-Australian man said the children who were left stranded in the areas were being cared for by their grandparents.   'They
 are desperate to get out, because there starts to see a shortage of 
face masks and other protective supplies,' the man who only wanted to be
 referred to as John told  The Australian .   'Many children are running out of baby formula powders soon,' he said.    The Australian government is now considering options to allow Australians in the infected areas to travel.   A
 China Eastern Flight from Wuhan arrives at Sydney International Airport
 on Thursday where health authorities were screening passengers for 
coronavirus   'The Government acknowledges the concerns of 
Australians who are in Hubei Province in China and the concerns of their
 families and friends,' Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a 
statement on Sunday.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The

untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      'The
 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese
 authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance 
with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese 
travel restrictions.   'Given the circumstances of the spread of the
 Coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight 
restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the 
Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are 
available to international travellers.   'Our Embassy in Beijing and
 our Consulate in Shanghai are also working with international partners 
and the Chinese government to determine what support can be given to 
Australians on the ground.'      Authorities are 
urging anyone who has travelled to the Wuhan region and experienced 
flu-like symptoms to contact their GP or local emergency 
department.     The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne  on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers.    A

Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared 
of the virus.     A Hobart man has tested negative for 
coronavirus on Sunday after he was admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital
 on Saturday with mild respiratory symptoms.   The man in his 30s had travelled to China earlier this month and spent time Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began.   He
 contacted a general practitioner with respiratory problems and was 
admitted into an isolation room in hospital while tests were conducted 
to rule out the infection.   Public Health services identified the 
man's contacts since returning to Hobart in case he had been identified 
as carrying the virus.   The man has been discharged from hospital after his results showed he was not infected.      What is the Chinese coronavirus?     The

Group A games are being played in South Korea, with only three teams 
competing - South Korea, Myanmar and Vietnam - after North Korea pulled 
out in December.   There are currently four confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, with fears more local cases are likely.   Coronavirus has killed 56 people in China and the city of Wuhan  remains in lockdown.   Three men are in hospital in Sydney after flying in from China, while another man in his 50s is being treated in Melbourne.   Two
 of the men hospitalised in Sydney flew directly from Wuhan, a 
53-year-old on January 20 and a 43-year-old two days prior. The third

 virus, which experts fear will 'highly likely' continue to spread in 
Australia, has so far killed 56 people in China and infected 2,000 
people worldwide.   Since the outbreak at the end of December, 
Chinese authorities have placed 56 million people in lockdown - 
including more than 100 Australian children aged between six months and 
16 years old, the  ABC     reported.       Photos
 taken outside Westmead Hospital on Sunday show a woman wearing a face 
mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and 
clothing.    Prof Murphy said there would likely be more cases in the country.   'There is no cause for general concern,' Prof Murphy said in Melbourne on Sunday.   'I would not be surprised if there are some more cases... it's highly likely that we may see some more.   'We are incredibly well prepared to isolate and deal with that.'    Emma Wei, from Melbourne, is trapped in Wuhan with her two children amid China's lockdown   Medical staff are seen wearing protective clothing outside a hospital in Wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak    NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

QUEENSLAND: 2      January 29      January 30       SOUTH AUSTRALIA   : 2     February 1       A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital.   The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   In
 the wake of the rapid spread, Chinese-Australian parents are now 
desperate for their children to get out of Wuhan in China's Hubei 
province.   Yi Xu is demanding his six-month-old daughter be brought home to Australia.   'The
 Australian Government needs to follow what the US is doing [and] to 
charter a plane to evacuate its citizens for emergency,' Mr Xu told the 
ABC after reports the U.S was using a plane to evacuate Americans from 
the area.     A father from Melbourne, Nathan Wang, said his 11-month-old daughter is stuck in Wuhan with his wife and other child.   Mr Wang said his family was struggling to access medical resources.    'I
 can't even fall asleep. As a father, I was very desperate. I am guilty 
that all of the risks and pressure were put on my wife alone,' he said.   Another Chinese-Australian man said the children who were left stranded in the areas were being cared for by their grandparents.   'They
 are desperate to get out, because there starts to see a shortage of 
face masks and other protective supplies,' the man who only wanted to be
 referred to as John told  The Australian .   'Many children are running out of baby formula powders soon,' he said.    The Australian government is now considering options to allow Australians in the infected areas to travel.   A
 China Eastern Flight from Wuhan arrives at Sydney International Airport
 on Thursday where health authorities were screening passengers for 
coronavirus   'The Government acknowledges the concerns of 
Australians who are in Hubei Province in China and the concerns of their
 families and friends,' Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a 
statement on Sunday.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      'The
 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese
 authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance 
with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese 
travel restrictions.   'Given the circumstances of the spread of the
 Coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight 
restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the 
Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are 
available to international travellers.   'Our Embassy in Beijing and
 our Consulate in Shanghai are also working with international partners 
and the Chinese government to determine what support can be given to 
Australians on the ground.'      Authorities are 
urging anyone who has travelled to the Wuhan region and experienced 
flu-like symptoms to contact their GP or local emergency 
department.     The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne  on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers.    A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first 
Australian case of coronavirus   He became the first confirmed
 case of coronavirus in Australia on Saturday morning and is now 
in quarantined isolation at Monash Hospital in Clayton in 
Melbourne's east.   Earlier on Saturday a baby was rushed from 
Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared 
of the virus.     A Hobart man has tested negative for 
coronavirus on Sunday after he was admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital
 on Saturday with mild respiratory symptoms.   The man in his 30s had travelled to China earlier this month and spent time Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began.   He
 contacted a general practitioner with respiratory problems and was 
admitted into an isolation room in hospital while tests were conducted 
to rule out the infection.   Public Health services identified the 
man's contacts since returning to Hobart in case he had been identified 
as carrying the virus.   The man has been discharged from hospital after his results showed he was not infected.     What is this virus?    The
 virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses 
are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory 
infections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be 
deadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a 
coronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the 
early 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 56 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.     What are the symptoms?    Its
 symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some 
patients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening 
infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. 
People carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such 
as a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek 
medical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The
 virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the 
rest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose 
potential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to 
disease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting 
infected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has
 an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because 
symptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries
 in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South
 Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia
 and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the 
UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts
 have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more 
than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere     "

one of the adults, who appeared to be holding a child with him, out of 
an ambulance and into the hospital.      A total of 
five cases have been confirmed in Australia, including four in NSW and

confirmed   Paramedics wearing protective clothing were
 seen taking one of the adults, who appeared to be holding a child with

 a 21-year-old Chinese student who flew into Sydney last week has been 
positively identified as having the virus after being admitted to the 
same hospital   Of those 13 suspected cases, five are in NSW, four in Western Australia and four in Queensland.      Australia's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said one case in Perth may prove positive.    'I'm
 advised that one of the people being tested in Perth may be positive, 
and the others look like they may be negative, but that's still to be 
confirmed,' he said in a press conference on Monday.    His 
state counterpart, Western Australia's chief health officer Andrew 
Roberston confirmed four individuals were under investigation but said 
the risk of the infection spreading is low.      'There
 are no confirmed cases in Western Australia to date. Results for three 
low risk cases who were previously tested for the illness have all 
returned negative,' Dr Robertson said.   'Although the risk to 
Western Australia to WA is considered low, testing will continue to be 
arranged for persons who meet exposure criteria and have a clinically 
compatible illness.'     'Due to the rapidly evolving 
nature of this situation, possible cases could arise at any time and the
 number of tests underway is expected to be fluid.'    A spokeswoman for Queensland Health also confirmed four new tests were being conducted on Monday.   Health
 authorities have been hunting for anyone who arrived in Australia from 
China's Wuhan City across the nation's major airports like Sydney 
airport (pictured)   Airports around the world have 
installed fact sheets (pictured) at airports for passengers who 
travelled to China's Wuhan city   'Through its Forensic 
and Scientific Services branch, Queensland Health are testing four 
patients for suspected coronavirus,' she said.   'Biologists are working around the clock with results expected in the coming hours. '   There have been no positive test for coronavirus in Queensland.   The
 news comes after officials confirmed on Monday a 21-year-old woman who 
flew into Sydney from Wuhan last week has tested positive for the 
illness.    The UNSW student arrived at Sydney International 
Airport on flight MU749 last Thursday and presented to the emergency 
department 24 hours later after developing flu-like symptoms.   NSW 
Health said she was being treated in isolation at Westmead Hospital and 
only had limited contact with people in Australia - reducing the 
likelihood that she had spread the virus.     'The student
 did not attend any classes at the university and stayed on her own in 
campus accommodation with no close contact before she was admitted to 
hospital,' a UNSW spokeswoman said in a statement.    Students
 at the  University of New South Wales were informed via email that
 a student has contracted the potentially deadly virus. The 21-year-old 
is being treated in isolation in Westmead Hospital in western 
Sydney    NSW Health is urging parents to consider 
keeping their children away from school if they have had any contact 
with infected individuals.     Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry 
Chant said any child who has been in contact with a person confirmed as 
having novel coronavirus must not attend school or childcare for 14 days
 after the last contact with the infected person.   'Fourteen days represents the internationally recognised likely incubation period for the disease,' Dr Chant said.   'After this time the child is considered to be not be at risk of infection.'      Three men - aged 35, 43 and 53 - in NSW are already being treated in hospital for coronavirus and are listed as stable.

The Press Association asked Dr Alan Gamlen, an associate 
professor leading the human geography programme at Monash University in 
Melbourne and researcher at the University of Oxford's Centre on 
Migration, Policy and Society, how such a system could work.   Australia has what is known as a general skilled migration 
programme, where immigrants applying for a visa are typically selected 
based on aeconomically relevant characteristicsa such as education, 
language skills and work experience. This does not apply for refugees 
and asylum seekers and there are other visas available with different 
requirements, like travel or holiday visas.   The exact way points are allocated changes depending on policy 
and the labour market but typically an applicant picks a askilled 
occupationa from a list and needs to score a minimum number of points. 
The visa application is submitted online after a series of checks and 
requires personal, financial and contact details, identity documents, as
 well as education, employment, health and travel history.   At present, an Australian visa for a askilled independent migranta needs 65 points.   Characteristics attracting the highest points include:   Fees vary depending on the  visa 
 but a skilled independent visa costs the equivalent of about APS2,169 
(A$4,045). Most visas are processed within 18 months and allow 
applicants to permanently work and study anywhere in Australia, as well 
as sponsor eligible relatives for permanent residence and, if eligible, 
eventually obtain Australian citizenship.   The points-based system used by Australia, Canada and New Zealand
 all areplaced colonial-era systems that explicitly discriminated 
between applicants based on race and ethnicitya, 
Dr Gamlen said. This system is considered fairer, more 
objective, and by capping the number of certain visas is thought to 
allow a country to choose what it considers to be athe besta immigrants 
and address staff shortages. But critics complain the approach presents a
 a narrow view 
 of what constitutes a valuable contribution to a societya, 
Dr Gamlen added, warning it could lead to abrain wastea, with 
surgeons ending up driving taxis, for example, if there are not enough 
positions to fill.   It would involve asome major changes to the UK's current  migration-management 
 systemsa which Dr Gamlen said have evolved in a amuch more ad
 hoc fashiona than some other countries. aIt would be difficult if not 
impossible to identify and transfer an Australian model to the UK 
context and achieve comparable outcomes,a he said. Australia's system 
involves long-term data collection, research and consultation. The 
system there has developed over decades and continues to change aso 
cannot be simply transplanted to the UKa, he added.   Introducing such a system awould likely involve trial and error over a significant period of time for the UK  immigration system 
 to develop into something more like the Australian systema, 
Dr Gamlen said. He warned that it may not solve amigration 
management issues, nor will it be a simple plug-and-play procedurea.    Press Association   "

 Goolagong Cawley, the Australian tennis champion who won seven major 
titles between 1971 and 1980, was retired and living well outside the 
tennis bubble when  Roger Federer  hit his stride. Even she could not help but notice.   Watching
 him play, Goolagong was struck by his skills. They seemed to be old 
school with a contemporary twist. Celebrated in her prime for her 
balletic movement and liquid, single-handed backhand, Goolagong felt an 
immediate affinity with Federer.   ""I thought, 'Wow,' here was 
someone with all the skills of his hero, Rod Laver,"" Goolagong told 
ESPN.com in a recent interview. ""He was magical to watch. Every time he 
turned his shoulder and then hit that one-handed backhand, it took me 
back. I thought, 'Oh, that must have felt good!'""   Goolagong, now 
68, also found herself wondering if Australia would ever produce another
 woman player who had a comparable skill set that  included a one-handed
 backhand slice and great touch around the net, abetted by a 
communicable passion for the game.   ""And now here we have  Ash [Barty] ,"" Goolagong said. ""She has all the old skills and values, and you can see that she just loves to play.""   Barty,
 the defending French Open champion, is currently in the hunt to become 
the first Australian of either gender to win the singles title at the 
Australian Open since Chris O'Neil won the women's event in 1978. 
Goolagong won the last of her four Australian Open titles in 1977, the 
year when she also won the French Open. She missed out on completing a 
career Grand Slam by faltering at the US Open despite playing in four 
finals there.   Barty, now 23, has known Goolagong since she made 
her Australian Open debut in 2012. ""I could tell she had it when I saw 
her that day [in 2012],"" Goolagong said. ""She played this one point in 
which she hit every shot. She lost that match but I knew then she would 
develop into what she is now.""   When Barty hit an emotional wall in
 2016 and quit the game for some 18 months, Goolagong was there for her.
 According to Ashleigh's father, Rob, the first text message his 
daughter received when the news of her hiatus broke was from Goolagong, 
who cheerily advised her, ""Good decision. Go and wet a line and catch a 
few fish.""   Apparently, it was just what Barty needed to hear. It 
was also the kind of wisdom that helped endear Goolagong to scores of 
fans and fellow players during a career that formally ended in 1983.   During
 her playing days, Goolagong was carefree, blithe, seemingly oblivious 
to the pressures and anxieties of her profession. Legend had it that her
 name in a long-lost language meant, ""Tall trees by still water,"" 
although an anthropologist later suggested the more accurate translation
 might have been ""Nose of the kangaroo.""   When Goolagong left the 
tennis circus, she had no desire to return or even to follow it. She 
yearned to explore her roots as an indigenous woman.   ""I had to 
learn about who I really [was],"" Goolagong said, ""That was important to 
get me through the difficulty I had in adjusting to life after the 
tour.""   The Goolagongs were the only Aboriginal family in the small
 town of Barellan in New South Wales. Her first racket, as she likes to 
tell the indigenous children who attend the various camps and events run
 by the Evonne Goolagong Foundation, was a board prised off an apple 
crate by her father, an itinerant sheep shearer, wheat grader and 
shade-tree mechanic.   At age 8, Goolagong read a story in 
""Princess"" magazine about a young girl who trained in tennis and was 
ultimately transported to this magical-looking place called Wimbledon. 
""I didn't know it [Wimbledon] existed,"" Goolagong said. ""Somebody told 
me it was in England, London. So every time I hit the ball against the 
wall I would pretend to be there.""   The journey in real life took a
 bit longer. Goolagong hit against any firm surface she could find, from
 water tanks to walls of houses, first with the board, later with 
hand-me-down rackets.   ""When I heard how Ash used to hit the ball 
against the side of her house, it reminded me of me,"" Goolagong said. ""I
 would try to see how many times I could hit the ball against the wall 
on one bounce before I missed. Every day I would write the number in the
 dirt and return the next day to try to beat it.""   Soon, the keen 
young athlete caught the eye of Barellan's townspeople. The first to 
notice her exceptional talent was a local man named Stan Smith (no 
relation to the American tennis champion). The Goolagongs' next-door 
neighbors were the Dunlops. Her life was taking on the properties of a 
song by the Beatles.   ""Some of the farmers and the president of the
 local tennis club drove me to small tournaments,"" Goolagong said. ""The 
townspeople took around a hat and collected funds for me to be able to 
go to Sydney for further training. They bought my suitcase, my clothes 
... everything. We didn't really have any money.""   Currency, no, 
but those dreams were realized at a heavy price. In Sydney, Goolagong 
became the protege of a well-known coach, Vic Edwards. She lived in his 
home as a member of the family. Edwards, a controlling, surrogate 
father, seemed a relic of the Victorian era. He also harbored demons 
that would assert themselves as time went on and Goolagong found 
success. By 1971, Goolagong, just 20, won the Australian and French 
Opens. In 1974, Goolagong's father, Kenny, was killed by a hit-and-run 
driver while crossing a road at dusk. He was just 44. Evonne spent the 
night under sedation at a hotel in Houston, a match against Chris Evert 
canceled and Edwards adamantly refusing to allow Goolagong to return 
home for her father's funeral.   Nine months after the death of her 
father, on the eve of Wimbledon, Goolagong secretly married a former 
British junior tennis player, Roger Cawley. The couple soon broke 
completely from Edwards. Goolagong's appetite for tennis returned and 
she flourished. She eventually became the only mother to have won the 
Wimbledon title since 1914, overcoming Evert in the final in 1980.   Aboriginal
 elders helped Goolagong face the unresolved anger and guilt she felt 
about not standing up to Edwards when he forbade her to attend her 
father's funeral. Goolagong went through ""women's business,"" a 
spiritual, somewhat secretive, ritual through which indigenous women 
explore their heritage. She became acquainted with tribal Ngangkari 
healers.   ""I would never have gotten where I was without support,"" 
she said. ""When we came back from America [the Cawleys lived in the 
United States for many years], I told Roger, 'I want to do for others 
what the townspeople did for me.'""   Goolagong
 served in various roles as a consultant in indigenous sport for some 
years, culminating with the formation of her eponymous foundation that 
aided indigenous children in 2005. It would become the focus of the 
Cawleys' life together, and remains so today. While Barty was busy 
pushing her way to the Australian Open quarterfinals, the Cawleys were 
just 12 miles away, but in many ways worlds apart, working at Monash 
University with indigenous children who earned places in the Evonne 
Goolagong Foundation's National Development Camp.   Between hitting 
sessions and presentations by a host of experts on subjects as far 
ranging as nutrition and career planning, the children watched 
Australian Open tennis, especially when Barty was playing. ""Oh, they all
 identify with Ash,"" Goolagong said. ""Even while the camp was going on 
they were finding ways to watch and cheer for her. She's a wonderful 
role model for our kids.""   Goolagong's program is focused less on 
pure tennis development and more on providing campers with the tools to 
be successful in whatever they choose to pursue. ""Our goal is keeping 
kids in schools and helping them achieve their dreams. It's all about 
having a healthy body and a healthy mind.""   The program, Goolagong 
said, has been a great hit. The retention rate in school (through Grade 
12) has been nearly 100 percent. The foundation has locked down 71 
scholarships approved by the Institute of Quality Education, and 18 
alumni of the program are currently enrolled in colleges or 
universities.   ""We just produced our first two doctors,"" Goolagong said. ""There will be more.""   Goolagong's
 activities did not go unnoticed by the Bartys. Ash has said her own 
interest in her heritage was fueled when she was about 8, and her 
father, Rob, sat her two older sisters down to explain their roots. Rob,
 a member of the Ngaragu tribe, worked for the government in indigenous 
affairs in the Australian state of Queensland for decades. Fascinated 
from the start, Ash embraced her heritage and eventually came to learn 
about Goolagong's own aboriginal pride, and her work with indigenous 
youth.   ""When I first met Evonne, I was gobsmacked,"" Barty told The
 Australian newspaper late in 2019, during a rare public appearance with
 Goolagong at a clinic for indigenous children in Cairns. ""She is this 
incredible lady who had a remarkable career. ... She has paved the way 
for so many people. When I was a bit older, I began to understand just 
how much of an impact she truly had and how much time and energy she has
 invested into creating opportunities for all indigenous youth across 
the nation.""   Goolagong has communicated with her friend on only 
one occasion in recent days, sending Barty a congratulatory text Friday 
when she was named 2020's ""Young Australian of the Year,"" and plans to 
attend the women's final if Barty advances.   ""Maybe one day it would be nice if we went out together and did women's business,"" Goolagong said.   It could happen, but like Goolagong in an earlier era, Barty has some tennis business to take care of first.  "

The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   Some
 students planned to still study, but called for them to be allowed to 
take their classes online to avoid campus during the coronavirus crisis.   'They
 should have an online only option, don't wanna get sick,' one wrote, 
while another said 'surely they are getting rid of all compulsory 
classes?'   Parents and friends also expressed concern, some warning students against setting foot on the Randwick complex.   'I would be concerned about my child going to that uni, who else has been infected! This is the scary part!' one mother wrote.   Another added: 'Now I can start to worry again my grand daughter has stared her first day of classes.'   NSW
 Health said the student was being treated in isolation at Westmead 
Hospital and only had limited contact with people in Australia - 
reducing the likelihood that she had spread the virus.     'The
 student did not attend any classes at the university and stayed on her 
own in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was 
admitted to hospital,' UNSW said in an email to students.   Students
 expressed frustration that the university did not specify which campus 
accommodation the student was staying in and would not tell them.   Photos
 taken outside Westmead Hospital on Sunday showed a young woman wearing a
 face mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and 
clothing.   Health authorities are now working to track down people the woman came into contact with and potentially infected.    NSW
 Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said test results for the most recent 
16 cases are expected by Wednesday afternoon, and will be shared with 
the public.    All 16 patients, 10 men and six women, who are 
believed to be carrying the virus are in isolation awaiting their test 
results.    Their ages range from just two years old through to 66.    'The
 fact we have 16 cases under investigation just reflects that we've 
broadened our testing... to focus on the Hubei province not just Wuhan 
and any contacts of confirmed cases,' Dr Chant told reporters in Sydney 
on Wednesday.   'That is to detect any cases and take a very 
precautionary approach. We're also increasingly realising the disease 
profile can be quite varying.'    'We want to get the message out there that even people with low-level symptoms should come forward,' Dr Chant said.    The state has so far tested more than 40 people.    A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first 
Australian case of coronavirus    Five
 people have the virus after returning from China's Hubei province, 
where coronavirus first surfaced in December. All are being treated in 
hospital and in a stable condition.     About 400 Australian citizens have registered for evacuation from the city of Wuhan in Hubei.     At
 this stage, health authorities do not believe people can pass on 
coronavirus unless they are showing symptoms, but the virus does have a 
relatively long incubation period of two weeks.     SCHOOLS    *
 Federal advice to school students who have returned to Australia from 
China is that if they are healthy, it is reasonable for them to attend 
school. If they have been in contact with somebody with coronavirus, 
they should not attend school for up to 14 days.   * But some 
Australian private schools have told students who have recently visited 
China to stay at home for a fortnight. Brisbane's Stuartholme School for
 girls will keep 10 of its boarders in quarantine for two weeks after 
they arrived from China this week.    NSW    * Four 
confirmed cases are being treated at Westmead Hospital: a 21-year-old 
University of NSW student who was diagnosed after flying back from the 
virus epicentre in Wuhan, and three men aged 35, 43 and 53.   * Six potential cases are being assessed.    VICTORIA    *
 One confirmed case, a man in his 50s, is being treated at Monash 
Medical Centre while four of his family are under home isolation.   A sixth case was confirmed on Wednesday.    * Thirteen people have been tested, but authorities do not believe they are likely to have the virus.   * 42 Victorians have tested negative.       SA    * Six people tested, awaiting results.   * One person tested and cleared.      WA    * Four people tested and cleared.   QUEENSLAND:   * Four people tested negative.    TASMANIA :   * A women in her 20s who recently travelled to China is being tested for coronavirus in Launceston after becoming unwell.   * A man was discharged from hospital on Sunday after testing negative.    THE WORLD    * Some 132 people have died from the virus in China   * The number of confirmed cases in China is 5974.   * In Thailand, which the worst affected country outside of China, the death toll is currently 14.   *
 The infection has also spread to most of Australia's regional 
neighbours including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and 
Cambodia.    TRAVEL WARNINGS    * The Australian 
government has told its citizens to reconsider travel to China and to 
avoid Hubei province where the virus first appeared in December.   * There are no travel warnings yet for other destinations in the Asian region.    MAJOR CONCERNS    *
 Global health authorities are on alert for cases of human-to-human 
transmission of the virus outside China, which could speed up infection 
rates.   * So far this has occurred in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam.   *
 Higher rates of human-to-human transmission is a reflection of the 
adaptability of the virus, which was is believed to have initially been 
transmitted to humans by animals.      Advertisement    "

The
 state's chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young confirmed on Wednesday a
 44-year-old Chinese national tested positive for the disease.   The
 man, who is from Wuhan - the epicenter of the deadly outbreak -  
is being treated in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital and is 
said to be stable.      The patient was reportedly one of 19 people who were being tested in the state on Wednesday.    There are now four cases in NSW, two in Victoria and one in Queensland.   The
 coronavirus toll has risen to seven in Australia, after one person was 
diagnosed in Victoria and another in Queensland on Wednesday. Above, a 
woman is seen wearing a protective mask while walking the streets in 
Cabramatta    People wearing face masks walk by 
Flinders Street Station after cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in
 Melbourne, Victoria on Wednesday    Earlier on Wednesday the Chinese women's national football team was isolated after arriving in Brisbane.   The
 team were in the city of Wuhan on January 22, and will be required to 
stay at their inner-city hotel to address risks that members may have 
the virus.   The 32 players, coaches and staff arrived in Brisbane 
on a flight from Shanghai and are required to stay in isolation until 
February 5.   Queensland health minister Steven Miles confirmed the hotel was in the centre of Brisbane.   New
 state government requirements demand residents to self-isolate for 14 
days from when they left Wuhan, says chief health officer Dr Jeannette 
Young.   'Anyone who has been in contact with a confirmed case must self-isolate in their homes,' she said.   Dr Young said the football team posed no risk to the Queensland community.   Since
 the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of December, Chinese authorities
 have placed 56 million people in lockdown. Pictured is a Chinese health
 worker taking a patient's temperature   Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath   'We
 are working closely with the hotel and the 32 individuals concerned, 
who are all well and not showing symptoms, and we have Queensland Health
 staff present at the hotel,' she said.   A further 19 people in the state have been tested for coronavirus.   The news comes just hours after a second person in Victoria was diagnosed with te virus.    The
 man tested positive in Victoria on Wednesday morning but doctors at the
 Monash Medical Centre assessed him as well enough to stay at home.   The
 state's health department said the man in his 60s became unwell on 
January 23 after returning from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre
 of the outbreak.   Although he had isolated himself after feeling 
unwell, he visited The House Of Delight restaurant in Glen Waverley with
 his family between 5.30pm and 7pm on January 26.   The department urged anyone who was at the restaurant during this time to be aware of symptoms.   'That
 restaurant is OK to go to now, people don't need to avoid the area or 
indeed anywhere else,' Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton 
said.   'For anyone else in the restaurant at a further distance and
 for a period of less than two hours ... the risk of transmission, 
although not absolutely excluded, is very low.'   Dr Sutton said health authorities had followed up with the restaurant, as well as patrons who were there on that evening.   The
 department said there is no current evidence that passengers or crew on
 the flight the man took to return to Melbourne are at risk.   Five of the man's family, three adults and two children, visited the restaurant with him and are also in home isolation.   One of them has tested negative to the virus, while the children are being kept from school.

Chinese city of Wuhan - lurked behind face masks.     Cabramatta

Jenny said she generally only put on a mask when in 'larger crowds in specific areas'.    'More like Chinese-dominated places like Burwood and Eastwood - the ones where I've heard there are confirmed cases,' she said.   'I've heard that in Cabramatta there might be a case too.'   Jenny said the mask was 'just a precaution' and that she would rather be safe than sorry.   She would be starting studies at the University of Western Sydney in March and was worried about that environment.   The
 worldwide spread of the coronavirus: The SARS-like disease is believed 
to have first spread from animals to humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan

 new 'novel' coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan in early December 
and has since spread to 13 countries including Australia.   It has 
killed at least 130 people and infected more than 6,000 worldwide but 
there have been no reported deaths outside of China.    Two new cases of the virus were confirmed in Australia on Wednesday bringing the national total to seven.      Victoria
 health officials confirmed a man had tested positive for the disease 
earlier this morning - marking the second confirmed case in the 
state.        The man, who is in his 60s, became  unwell on January 23 and  was subsequently seen by doctors at the Monash Medical Centre.      He has since been  assessed as being well enough to stay at home.   Hours later, Queensland confirmed its first case after a 44-year-old Chinese national was diagnosed with the virus.   He is being treated in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital.    Four people who tested positive in NSW remain in hospital in stable condition.     Those
 seven people had all recently visited Wuhan, where the Huanan Wholesale
 Seafood Market is considered a likely source of the 
outbreak.     Such 'wet' markets sell meat and seafood alongside live animals such as dogs, rats, snakes, civets and supposedly koalas.   The proximity of people to live and dead animals makes it easy for humans to contract viruses.   The SARS virus which broke out in 2003 also likely started in wet markets.   SARS was originally hosted by bats which infected other animals. Those animals transmitted SARS to humans.   Making
 matters worse, authorities fear another 16 people, including a 
two-year-old, could have contracted China's deadly coronavirus in New 
South Wales alone.    New South Wales' Chief Health Officer 
Kerry Chant said test results for the most recent 16 cases are expected 
by Wednesday afternoon, and will be shared with the public.    All
 16 patients, 10 men and six women, who are believed to be carrying the 
virus are in isolation awaiting their test results.    Their ages range from just two years old through to 66.    The
 chief health officer confirmed there were still only four confirmed 
cases in NSW and two of those patients are well and truly on the 
mend.    Meanwhile, Victoria confirmed its second case on 
Wednesday, bringing the total number of those infected in Australia to 
six.     In Cabramatta, a young man wearing a face mask outside Dutton Plaza said he was going about his business as usual.   'I'm
 not really worried,' he said on Wednesday afternoon. 'I'm just 
taking precaution because of what is happening in China.    Many shoppers Daily Mail Australia spoke to said they were taking precautions 'because of what's happening in China'      Several

 to worry about: Shopper Tuan said 'well be all right' and warned people
 to 'be sensible but not panicking too much ... generally speaking it 
should be fine'    'But generally in Australia we'll be all right. If something (more serious) happens it would be all over the news.   'We have friend in China - she's very worried about everything.'   Tuan's attitude was: 'Be sensible but not panicking too much.'   'Generally speaking, it should be fine,' he said.   'When we go to the public places where there's so many people you don't know whether they've travelled overseas.   'You can't tell that. That could be a problem.'   He and Tien would continue to avoid large crowds when possible and monitor news reports.   'I don't need to go out and hunt for the masks,' he said.   His wife felt the same way.   'We don't worry,' she said. 'Just be positive.'   Another man shopping with his wife and young son, who was the only one of the three wearing a mask, did not have time to talk.   'I want to take him home as quickly as possible because of the coronavirus,' he said.   Bogus
 social media scare campaigns have tried to link the spread of the virus
 to the sale of Chinese food products in Sydney suburbs with large Asian
 populations such as Cabramatta.   One fake 'urgent health notice' 
being circulated wrongly claims tests of air at train stations including
 Cabramatta and Strathfield have detected coronavirus.    Fearmongering:
 A hoax Facebook post wrongly claims that a 'bureau of diseasology' 
(which does not exist) had run tests in several Sydney suburbs with 
large Asian populations - including Cabramatta and Burwood    Such messages are often accompanied by advice that residents and visitors to those areas wear face masks and gloves.   A
 middle-aged woman shopping in Cabramatta with her son said the pair 
wore masks whenever they were out in public, 'just to protect 
ourselves'.   In the face of bogus scare campaigns, printing 
businessman Dong Yang said 'I don't think it's that serious ... there's 
no need to wear the masks in Australia'   'We're just worried about the coronavirus,' she said. 'Just when we go out to places where there's a lot of people.'   No one wearing a mask took it off when asked why there were wearing one.   Dong
 Yang, who runs a printing business, was not wearing a mask and said 
more people covered their faces in Cabramatta when bushfire smoke 
enveloped Sydney.   'I don't think it's that serious,' the 62-year-old said of the coronavirus threat as he shopped with his wife.   'And also the authorities say maybe there's no need to wear the masks in Australia.   'We believe the authorities and what the government says. I think in Australia it's under good control.   'Everything should be okay. Actually we're not worried too much about it.'   Mr
 Yang had instead been concentrating on raising funds to send masks and 
protective clothing to his homeland in his role as chairman of the 
Australia-China Business Summit.     'I don't wanna die at

while another said 'surely they are getting rid of all compulsory 
classes?'   Students at the University of NSW where a classmate was diagnosed with coronavirus say they are too afraid to go back to class   Emma Wei, from Melbourne, is trapped in Wuhan with her two children amid China's lockdown   Parents and friends also expressed concern, some warning students against setting foot on the Randwick complex.   'I would be concerned about my child going to that uni, who else has been infected! This is the scary part!' one mother wrote.   Another added: 'Now I can start to worry again my grand daughter has stared her first day of classes.'   NSW
 Health said the student was being treated in isolation at Westmead 
Hospital and only had limited contact with people in Australia - 
reducing the likelihood that she had spread the virus.     'The
 student did not attend any classes at the university and stayed on her 
own in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was 
admitted to hospital,' UNSW said in an email to students.   Students
 expressed frustration that the university did not specify which campus 
accommodation the student was staying in and would not tell them.   Photos
 taken outside Westmead Hospital on Sunday showed a young woman wearing a
 face mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and 
clothing.   Health authorities are now working to track down people the woman came into contact with and potentially infected.     Symptoms of coronavirus infection include coughing, fever and breathing difficulties.    Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death.    The current coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected host coughs or sneezes.    It can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces such as hand rails and door handles.    None of the cases detected in Australia has involved local person to person transmission.    Coronavirus
 has an incubation period of between one and 14 days and there are fears
 it can be spread before symptoms are showing.    There is no specific medicine to treat the virus at this stage.   "

 players arrived to Australia at 9am on Wednesday after the Chinese
 Football Association moved the side's Olympic qualifying matches to 
Australia when the outbreak started.     The team was in 
the city of Wuhan on January 22, and will be required to stay at their 
inner-city hotel until February 5 over fears that members may have the 
deadly coronavirus.   The 32 players, coaches and staff arrived in Brisbane on a flight from Shanghai, but new regulations force them to be isolated.   The
 Chinese woman's national team is reportedly being quarantined at a 
Brisbane hotel. Pictured: China Eastern Airlines cabin crew are 
seen wearing protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport on 
Wednesday   Queensland health minister Steven Miles confirmed the hotel was in the centre of Brisbane.   New
 state government requirements demand residents to self-isolate for 14 
days from when they left Wuhan, says chief health officer Dr Jeannette 
Young.   'Anyone who has been in contact with a confirmed case must self-isolate in their homes,' she said.   Dr Young said the football team posed no risk to the Queensland community.   A further 19 people in the state were tested for coronavirus on Wednesday.    The
 footballers' isolation follows news hours earlier that experienced 
midfielder Wang Shuang and 22-year-old Yao Wei were among several 
absentees from the team as it touched down in Queensland.   The pair
 were among a group of at least four players who returned to their 
native Wuhan for Chinese New Year, with the city since placed in 
lockdown following the outbreak of the virus which has killed dozens and
 left thousands ill.   A team official told AAP on Tuesday Wang and Yao were unavailable due to travel restrictions.   The
 players will remain at home in isolation and under observation but it's
 understood none have shown any related symptoms of the virus.   Paramedics completely covered in decontamination gear attended a suspected coronavirus case in the Gold Coast on Tuesday   The absences are a big blow to the Steel Roses.   Wang
 has played over 100 matches for China, scoring 28 goals, while Yao was a
 member of last year's World Cup squad and has made 22 international 
appearances.   Wuhan was the original location for the Group B fixtures in the final round of Asian qualifiers for this year's Olympics.   The
 six group matches also featuring Australia, Thailand and Taiwan were 
originally relocated to Nanjing and then Sydney after China withdrew as 
hosts at the weekend.   The Chinese team trained in isolation in Suzhou before departing for Australia.   Pictured: A patient heading in to Westmead Hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus   Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath   Along with staff, they all underwent testing before departure with none returning a positive.    'They
 went through all the same checks that any Chinese national flying in 
from China would have gone through,' FFA chief executive James Johnson 
said.   'We're confident in the government's checks and balances.'    The team was scheduled to play against Thailand for the tournament opener at Campbelltown Stadium on Monday.    So
 far, the deadly virus, officially named 2019 novel coronavirus 
(2019-nCoV), has killed 132 people in China and infected more than 6000 
across 16 countries.    In Australia, there are currently four confirmed cases in New South Wales, and two in Victoria.     NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of 
the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province.    Chief 
Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with 
someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no 
need for current concern.     Advertisement    "

While the risk of getting the illness in the UK is low, recognising the 
symptoms of coronavirus is important in preventing its spread.   The current strain of coronavirus has been likened to flu, but is there a defining symptom to watch out for?   According
 to Professor Stephen Turner, Head of the Department of Microbiology at 
Monash Universityas Biomedicine Discovery Institute, spotting the 
difference between coronavirus and flu can be difficult.   When 
asked if there was a defining symptom of coronavirus virus, he said: 
aNot really, both cause very similar symptoms which is fever, chills, 
aches and often trouble breathing, indicative of a respiratory 
infection.a   Professor Turner notes the first symptoms of coronavirus to look out for.

DON'T MISS    The health body has now urged people to follow this advice even if you donat have symptoms of the virus.   Currently, all travel to Wuhan should be avoided unless essential.   If people have to travel to the area they should make sure to wash their hands regularly with soap and water.   They should also avoid visiting animal and bird markets, and avoid contact with anyone who is ill with a cough.           Coronavirus symptoms: A cough is one of the first signs to look out for  (Image: GETTY)     As of January 28, a total of 97 UK tests of suspected coronavirus were confirmed as negative   There are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad.   Gov.uk
 has advised when a first case in the UK is confirmed it will be 
announced as soon as possible by the Chief Medical officer of the 
affected county.   This will be followed by a statement by Englandas Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty.           Coronavirus symptoms: A fever is another early sign of the illness  (Image: GETTY)     The health body adds: aWe have introduced advanced monitoring at airports with direct flights from China.   A
 team of public health experts has been established in Heathrow to 
support anyone travelling in from China who feels unwell. These hubs 
will bring in rotational teams of seven clinicians, working in shifts, 
who will be on hand to support patients on arrival.   aThis is in 
addition to medical staff who are already permanently in place at all UK
 airports and the advice issued to all UK airports for people travelling
 to and from China.a   It adds: aMost people who develop symptoms 
will get them after leaving the airport and so the priority is providing
 UK residents and travellers with the latest information to make sure 
they know what to do if they experience symptoms, and the NHS and Public
 Health England (PHE) have an established plan to respond to someone who
 becomes unwell.   aChina has also introduced port-of-exit screening so people already exhibiting symptoms are not allowed to leave the country.a  "

 triggers flu-like symptoms in people who catch it, including fever, a 
cough, or difficulty breathing. Like flu, the virus is airborne and very
 contagious, and people are being asked to take simple, common-sense 
steps to avoid close contact with other people as much as possible - 
particularly people who have rented from Wuhan in the last 14 days.   In
 China more than 130 people have died from Wuhan novel coronavirus, and 
cases have been confirmed in Thailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, 
Taiwan and the US.   As of January 28, a total of 97 UK tests of 
suspected coronavirus were confirmed as negative, but there are 
currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad.   Face
 masks are famously used to stop the spread of airborne viruses, like 
flu, but can they protect against coronavirus and should Britons 
consider wearing them when they leave the UK?   According to

 as long as they are the right sort.

 said, masks especially help with limiting transmission if someone is 
infected as they won't be sneezing and spreading the virus via droplets.   aAlso
 good to practice regular hand washing with soap, avoid touching 
eyes/mouth if out and about, if feeling ill stay at home, if you use a 
tissue, throw it out once used.""   The two main face masks being stockpiled are surgical masks and N95 respirators.    DON'T MISS    World
 Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines say healthcare workers treating 
patients should wear them, in addition to gloves, goggles and gowns.   Theyare believed to be more effective in a clinical setting in accompaniment with other protective measures.   For
 the general population, surgical masks donat completely seal off the 
weareras nose and mouth, so droplets may still get in, and the eyes are 
also left exposed.   Some tiny particles will also be able to pass 
through the fabric of surgical masks, and some surgical masks are not 
designed to be used more than once.           Coronavirus latest: Surgical masks don't completely seal off the wearer's nose and mouth  (Image: GETTY)     The

A Chinese woman in Melbourne was confirmed to have the virus on Thursday, the eighth case in Australia.    Meanwhile, concerns are growing over a Tiger Airlines domestic flight which an infected man boarded last week.     Authorities

started earlier this month, and medical protection equipment is now in 
vogue   Australian authorities are trying to track down
 everyone who was on board a Tiger Airways flight from Melbourne to the 
Gold Coast on January 27, as an infected man was a passenger   The
 man came from Wuhan - the Chinese city at the epicentre of the virus 
outbreak - and flew in to Melbourne via Singapore on January 22.    He
 spent five days in the city before flying north to the Gold Coast, 
where he became increasingly unwell at his accommodation and called an 
ambulance.    He is in isolation in hospital.      Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles said authorities were trying to track down everyone on board.    He said anyone on the flight should contact Queensland Health immediately for advice, but there was no need for panic.   The government is examining eight members of that man's tour group. Four are unwell and are being tested today.     Meanwhile,
 in New South Wales, authorities fear as many as 16 other Australians in
 New South Wales may have contracted the disease.    Four people there have been diagnosed with the disease, and two in Victoria.    The Federal government is planning to quarantine Australians evacuated from Wuhan on isolated Christmas Island.    More than 162 people have died around the world from the virus.

shelters a four person Sri Lankan asylum seeker family.    The 
disease, which has killed at least 162 people around the world, is 
believed to have come from Wuhan, a city of 11 million 
people.     The virus is believed to have spread from the 
Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market. Such 'wet' markets sell meat and 
seafood alongside live animals such as dogs, rats, snakes, civets and 
supposedly koalas.   The proximity of people to live and dead animals makes it easy for humans to contract viruses.   The SARS virus which broke out in 2003 also likely started in wet markets.

 Australian government on Wednesday announced the 'humanitarian' mission
 to get its citizens out of the disease epicentre in the Chinese 
province of Hubei as more than 600 Australian citizens in the 
region registered for advice or assistance.   Chinese officials 
confirmed on Thursday the country's death toll had risen to 170 from 132
 the day before, while the number of infections jumped 30 per cent to 
7,700.   With infections continuing to rise, medical teams are bound
 for Christmas Island to deal with Australian coronavirus evacuees in a 
bid to protect the mainland from the deadly disease.    The
 plan to use Christmas Island detention centre (pictured) as a 
quarantine site for Australians evacuated from coronavirus-stricken 
Hubei province has been slammed    Christmas Island Shire president Gordon Thomson told  ABC News  the decision would turn the island into a 'leper colony'.   'Saw
 PM's announcement. Regressive colonial era ideas since 2001. Create 
convict settlement for innocent people - now we'll be a leper colony,' 
Mr Thomson said in a text message.    It is unclear how many 
evacuees will be put into quarantine on Christmas Island, which sits 
1,650 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia.   Earlier, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton defended the Christmas Island plan, saying it would help keep Australia safe.   'I
 can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 
people. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of 
people,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday.   Australian diplomats are continuing negotiations with Chinese authorities to clear the way for the evacuation mission.   Officials
 at Thailand's Bangkok airport prepare to disinfect the cabin of an 
aircraft to prevent the spread of coronavirus on Tuesday   Christmas
 Island Shire president Gordon Thomson said the quaratine decision would
 turn the island (detention centre, pictured) into a 'leper colony'   Qantas has offered its aircraft for use in the evacuation, which is a joint operation with New Zealand.     On
 Thursday, Health Minister Greg Hunt revealed two Australians in China's
 Guangdong Province had contracted the virus, but had been treated and 
appeared to be okay.   'They have been treated and the advice that I
 have - and I would want to be cautious on this - is that they have been
 released and are not seeking consular assistance at this stage,' he 
told reporters.   Mr Hunt said Australia's actions were driven by 
medical advice, and the World Health Organization was strong in its 
support for quarantine measures to stem the spread of the virus.   'Our
 job is to protect Australians and provide support for citizens overseas
 and the best way to do that is to find a place which was designed to 
deal with people who were coming (from) overseas... and to do that in a 
way which is humane,' Mr Hunt said.   'This is a humanitarian 
mission. ... It protects Australians home but it provides a pathway home
 for those Australians who are in Hubei.'   Mr Hunt said the 
National Critical Care and Trauma Centre had secured the personnel they 
need for Christmas Island, and teams would begin heading there later 
today.    There are seven confirmed cases of the deadly virus 
in Australia: four in New South Wales, two in Victoria and one in 
Queensland, and others are being tested in various states.    Two Australians have been diagnosed with the virus in China.       NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

 McLean, who is from Ulladulla on the New South Wales South Coast, moved
 to  Ezhou last year to be with his partner Qiong Xu.    Ezhou
 is in the east of the Hubei province of China and near the epicentre of
 the coronavirus outbreak. The city was one of the first to 
be locked down this month.    Travel both in and out of 
the city and surrounding areas cancelled to prevent the virus from 
spreading. The streets of the normally bustling city, which is home to 
more than one million people, have been abandoned.    Tim McLean, who is from Ulladulla on the New South Wales South Coast, moved to Ezhou last year to be with his partner Qiong Xu   'Yesterday
 I was out in the street and I saw hospital staff walking around in full
 white protective clothing, head gear, totally airtight, walking with 
what looked like patients,' Mr McLean told the  ABC .   'I put two masks on when I go outside, just in case.'   A
 simple trip to the supermarket is an ordeal Mr McLean. Before stepping 
into the store customers are met by a government official holding a 
thermometer.    They must have their temperature taken before they can even step inside.    Mr McLean moved to Ezhou to be with Qiong Xu after the pair met while she was studying in Australia.   He
 returned to China in mid-January after spending Christmas in Australia.
 He had no idea the hell he was stepping into when he arrived back.   Mr McLean moved to Ezhou to be with Qiong Xu after the pair met while she was studying in Australia   While
 he said he has no regrets about moving over, the impending risk of 
contracting the deadly virus, which has already claimed more than 100 
lives, is scary.    There is also the looming threat that food may come to a grinding halt in a couple days, he said.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      He said they had been told get a bulk supply of rice and sit it out for a week and a half.   Mr McLean is one of about 600 Australians trapped at epicentre of the outbreak.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison announced a plan on Wednesday to evacuate 
Australians trapped at the epicentre of China's deadly virus and 
quarantine them on the remote island for 14 days.   Mr McLean said 
he has struggled to contact the Australian embassy in Shanghai as 
it appears to have been closed for Chinese New Year, from January 
27-29.    Mr McLean has been spending his days riding his bike through the empty streets.   'It's quiet. It's about zero degrees. It can be minus degrees at night. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest.'    China has confirmed there are now more than 6,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 132 deaths.   The
 virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in
 the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.    Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species.   The World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan at the end of December.    Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath   Medical
 staff members wearing protective clothing to help stop the spread of a 
deadly virus which began in the city, arrive with a patient at the Wuhan
 Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan    Chinese authorities confirmed they had identified a new virus a week later.   The
 new virus, identified by scientists as 2019-nCoV, is a coronavirus, a 
family of viruses that include the common cold and more serious diseases
 such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).   Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.   It is unclear how deadly the new virus is.    Although severe cases can cause pneumonia and death, there may be many cases of milder disease going undetected.    Many of those who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly with weakened immune systems.    People

infected people have - like railings or medical tools , then touching

 other countries with confirmed cases include Australia, Cambodia, 
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, 
Thailand, South Korea, the UAE, the United States, and Vietnam.    The Chinese government has put Wuhan into virtual quarantine to try and stop the spread of the virus.    A

leaving the store bare of supplies.   A representative from Chemist 
Warehouse Chatswood told Daily Mail Australia that they had no face

 more stock would become available.   'Masks have been in really

the masks have been in short supply.'   A sign posted outside of Chemist Warehouse's store in Chatswood reading 'no masks available, out of stock'   Face masks have been in high demand over the bushfire season   Now, face masks are seeing increased demand due to corona virus fears   However, face masks are not 100% effective as they do not completely seal off the mouth and nose    Face masks are more effective at quarantining an infected person    Professionals say that washing your hands is the best protection as it can stop virus from spreading    This is why hand sanitisers are selling out across Australia     Face
 mask sales initially increased amid poor air quality and smokey 
conditions through Australia's terrible bushfire season, causing 
wholesalers to run out of supplies.   Chatswood Chemist Warehouse 
received their last delivery of face masks in the beginning of January 
and have since run out, and have been trying to order more every day to 
keep up with customers demand.   The representative said 'every five
 minutes' customers are asking when they will get more stock, and that 
their suppliers had began to run out of product.   Chemist Warehouse Chatswood stock ten different brands of hand sanitiser, and all of them are vacant from their shelves.   Their
 last delivery of hand sanitisers lasted less than one day, with the 
entire shipment of stock being sold out in one mornings trade.   Signs
 have been put up in chemists around the country including Chemist 
Warehouse in Chatswood to notify customers that there are no supplies of
 face masks and hand sanitisers   Chemist Warehouse stores 
contacted by Daily Mail Australia in Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane 
all confirmed having no face masks or hand sanitiser in stock.   Daily Mail Australia have reached out to Chemist Warehouse Australia for comment.    On Tuesday, Priceline in North Sydney was delivered 300 masks but ran out by 2pm.    In addition, Bunnings hardware stores were either sold out of P2 and N95 masks or quickly running out of stock.   The
 deadly coronavirus has killed 133 people and infected more than 6,000 
people in more than a dozen countries around the world.   There are

 Chinese Australian community has urged the public not to blame them for
 the coronavirus outbreak after a fake health notices fueled racist 
abuse.    Nine Australians have been diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus - seven in NSW, Victoria and Queensland and two in  China 's Guangdong province.    Hoax
 health notices discouraging people from visiting Australian suburbs 
with large Chinese populations and eating Asian food have been 
circulating online this week.   Following the false claims, Apple technician Harry Xin said he had a racist encounter watching the  Australian Open  at Rod Laver Arena in  Melbourne  on Wednesday.    'We
 are Chinese, we are not a virus, we are as part of this world as 
anybody, so stand against discrimination, of any kind! Fight until we 
are treated the same as if we were born with coloured eyes,' he wrote on
 Facebook.    Hoax health notices targeting the Chinese 
people has prompted community leaders to urger the Australian public not
 to blame them for coronavirus. Pictured: A woman wearing a face mask to

 watching the Australian Open at Rod Laver Arena (pictured) in Melbourne
 on Wednesday   Mr Xin, who is an Australian of Chinese 
decent, was queuing up for food when two men pushed in fron of him and 
began talking about coronavirus.    'They started to talk about
 the Coronavirus. They were talking quietly but not quiet enough, as if 
they think I can't understand what they were saying,' he said.    'I heard pieces of ""a|they eat snakea|and travel all around the worlda|they try to take everything"".    'I
 was p***ed enough to the point where I turned around and said: 
""everything on you is probably made in China, show some respect"" and 
walked away.'    Mr Xin, who is the former president of the 
Melbourne University Chinese Students Association, said his community is
 constantly racially vilified in Australia - and the coronavirus 
outbreak has only made it worse.     'The discrimination 
HAS TO STOP! We deserve the same rights as everybody else who lives 
here, even though people judge us by our colour, assume that we don't 
speak English, get passed on in interviews and promotions, we still keep
 our head down and never complain,' he wrote.    'We pour our 
heart and soul, blood and sweat to adjust to this life, to fit in, TO BE
 AUSTRALIAN, but we shouldn't have to do any of this, endure any of 
this!'    Increased discrimination against Chinese people comes
 after two false health notices claiming to be from health bodies in NSW
 and Queensland.    The University of Queensland Chinese
 Association of Postgraduates and Scholars (pictured) spokesperson said:
 'We are not the virus. We will protect ourselves from the virus and 
also protect others.'    Earlier this week, a hoax health
 notice that claimed to be from the Queensland Department of Health 
circulated, urging people to 'avoid all populated areas with Chinese 
nationals of ratio of 1 to 3 non-Chinese'.    Brisbane suburbs 
with large Asian populations Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hill, Runcorn and
 Eight Mile Plane were listed as areas to be avoided, in addition to 
Wuhan, China, where coronavirus is believed to have 
originated.      State MP Duncan Pegg, who is based in Sunnybank Hills, debased the false health notice on Monday.    'This
 media release is 100% FAKE!!! FAKE!!! FAKE!!! I don't normally like to 
give any credence to ppl who seek to malign our community but wanted to 
make things clear this time,' Mr Pegg wrote on Twitter.     On
 Wednesday, NSW Health stamped out a laughable fake notice from the
 'Department of Diseasology Paramatta' that incorrectly termed 
coronavirus as 'Corna's Disease'.      Asian foods 
and the Sydney suburbs with large Asian populations such as Cabramatta, 
Burwood, Strathfield were targeted in hoax notice.     In a
 statement, NSW Health said: 'This post has not originated from NSW
 Health or any related entity. Further, there is no such entity as the 
""Department of Diseasology Parramatta"".   'NSW Health would like to 
assure the community that the locations mentioned in this post pose no 
risk to visitors, and there have been no 'positive readings' at train 
stations.'    Earlier this week, a hoax health notice

the Chinese community have reported increased racial discrimination, 
both online and in person, since the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan,

doing their best to combat the disease on Thursday.   'We are not the virus. We will protect ourselves from the virus and also protect others,' a UQCAPS spokesman told the  Gold Coast Bulletin .   Queensland
 Chinese Forum Honorary President Dr Kee Cheung OAM told the publication
 that: 'There are a lot of malicious messages circulating among the 
community.'    Dr Kee said people were being told not to travel
 to Chinese areas and some Chinese students were being refused entry by 
their landlords after returning from their home country.   Meanwhile,
 an anonymous  University of Queensland Chinese student told 
the Bulletin that people try to keep their distance from her in 
public.    She also said her friend's child was being bullied 
in school while another friend was denied entrance into a restaurant

 disease, which has killed at least 162 people around the world, is 
believed to have come from Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.   The
 virus is believed to have spread from the Huanan Wholesale Seafood 
Market. Such 'wet' markets sell meat and seafood alongside live animals 
such as dogs, rats, snakes, civets and supposedly koalas.   The proximity of people to live and dead animals makes it easy for humans to contract viruses.

brawl.     The Sydney women, aged 33 and 36, had entered a
 heated online debate in a mother's Facebook group on Tuesday about the 
health effects of the coronavirus.   To settle the argument, the women decided to meet in person at Brookvale at 8.10pm, each bringing with them a support person.   Two women have ended up in hospital after an online argument over the coronavirus turned violent (stock image)   'The
 argument quickly escalated from verbal to physical; pushing, slapping, 
hair pulling and finally both on the ground, briefly unconscious, all 
despite the efforts of bystanders trying to intervene,' police 
said.     The two women accompanying them, who were also from the group chat, tried to separate the pair.    The 36-year-old required a scan for a possible brain injury and was treated for a shoulder injury and a cut to her arm.   The
 younger woman underwent X-rays for a shoulder injury as well as 
treatment for cuts, bruising and swelling to her arms, upper body and 
neck.    Police have taken out a Personal Violence Order for one of the women as investigations continue.    Both women have since been released from hospital.    Facebook users were quick to comment, with many suggesting the women weren't setting a good example for their kids.   Northern Beaches Police shared the story to their Facebook on Thursday, where it quickly went viral   'Bloody

 42-year-old woman who flew into the country on a Tigerair flight TT56 
on Monday was confirmed to be infected in the Gold Coast on Thursday 
evening.   She was travelling with a 44-year-old man who has already been confirmed as having the killer virus.    Their
 companions - who include children - are being tested. At least four of 
them, including the children, are among those showing symptoms of the 
virus.   The group were staying at a hotel in Broadbeach.   The development came just hours after a woman in her 40s,  from China's Hubei province - the epicentre of coronavirus - was found to have the virus in Melbourne.      People
 wearing face masks walk by Flinders Street Station after cases of the 
coronavirus were confirmed in Melbourne on Wednesday    Nine cases in Australia have been confirmed - four in NSW, three in Victoria and two in Queensland   She went to a GP and was referred to hospital, where tests later found that she had contracted the virus.   She has been in Australia for about a week and had reportedly been showing symptoms for two or three days.   The woman is now being treated in isolation at Royal Melbourne Hospital.    The
 total number of Australian cases is now nine, with three of those in 
Victoria, four in New South Wales and two in Queensland.   Two other Australians have been infected in China.    Meanwhile, concerns are growing over a Tiger Airlines domestic flight which an infected man boarded last week.     Authorities
 are seeking to track down other passengers on board Flight TT566 from 
Melbourne to the Gold Coast, on January 27.    The other 
infected man to fall ill from the Gold Coast was from Wuhan - the 
Chinese city at the epicentre of the virus outbreak - and flew in to 
Melbourne via Singapore on January 22.    He developed symptoms on the flight, which was carrying about 150-200 passengers.    He
 spent five days in the city before flying north to the Gold Coast, 
where he became increasingly unwell at his accommodation and called an 
ambulance.    He was travelling with eight other tourists, four of whom have fallen ill and are being tested for the virus.    Australian
 authorities are trying to track down everyone who was on board a Tiger 
Airways flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on January 27, as an 
infected man was a passenger   Mr Joyce said it was too
 early to say what impact the coronavirus outbreak might have on the 
carrier's business (people leaving arrivals terminal at Sydney 
International Airport)   China Eastern Airlines cabin wear a protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport   He is in isolation in hospital.    Tiger
 Airways says it's in the process of contacting affected passengers and 
crew members, and would direct them to see their doctors.   Anyone 
who was on the flight has also been urged to call Queensland Health to 
ensure they take the safest and most appropriate action.   A total 
of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in Australia 
from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the world.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      Based
 on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have entered Australia 
from China since the deadly virus was first detected in Wuhan seven 
weeks ago.   On Thursday, major airlines suspended or reduced 
services to China including British Airways, Lufthansa, American 
Airlines, KLM, and United.   But the airlines that fly from China to
 Australia - including eight Chinese airlines and Qantas - made no 
changes to their routes, except for China Eastern cancelling its flight 
from Wuhan to Sydney last week.   The flights include 62 planes from
 Guangzhou, 42 from Shanghai and 18 from Beijing per week, with direct 
routes to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Darwin.   On 
Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline was 
considering scrapping its Sydney to Beijing route due to low demand.   The airline had already announced plans to axe that service from March, but Mr Joyce suggested that could happen sooner.    He also said it was too early to say what impact the coronavirus outbreak might have on the carrier's business.   He
 said the most similar comparison to coronavirus was the 2003 SARS 
epidemic in 2003, which cost the airline $55 million in lost earnings 
over a six to eight-month period and led it to cut some international 
capacity.    Meanwhile, in New South Wales, authorities fear as
 many as 16 other Australians in New South Wales may have contracted the
 disease.    Four people there have been diagnosed with the disease, and three in Victoria.    Some 170 people have died from the virus in mainland China and more than 7,000 have been infected worldwide    People are seen leaving the arrivals terminal at Sydney International airport on January 29, 2020   The Federal government is planning to quarantine Australians evacuated from Wuhan on isolated Christmas Island.    The
 disease, which has killed at least 162 people around the world, is 
believed to have come from Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.   The
 virus is believed to have spread from the Huanan Wholesale Seafood 
Market. Such 'wet' markets sell meat and seafood alongside live animals 
such as dogs, rats, snakes, civets and supposedly koalas.   The proximity of people to live and dead animals makes it easy for humans to contract viruses.   The SARS virus which broke out in 2003 also likely started in wet markets.   SARS was originally hosted by bats which infected other animals. Those animals transmitted SARS to humans.

About
 600 Australians are trapped in the Hubei province as the deadly 
disease that has so far killed 170 people and affected more than 7,000 
in  China  continues to spread.    The Federal Government on Wednesday announced plans to evacuate Australians via a  Qantas  jet, but confirmed the following day evacuees would have to pay up before they stepped foot on the plane.    'People
 have to pay for the flight from China back to Australia. Thatas, as Iam
 advised by DFAT, the normal way in which these things occur and that 
will be the limit of the contribution,' Home Affairs Minister Peter
 Dutton said on Thursday.      Those hoping to escape the 
virus epicentre will also have to sign a waiver to agree to staying in 
quarantine on the Island's detention centre for 14 days.   People are seen leaving the Sydney Airport terminal wearing facemasks over fears of the deadly coronavirus   Evacuees
 have been contacted by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and
 Trade about the flight, which is expected to arrive in a matter of 
days,  The Sydney Morning Herald  reported.   After the Australians are quarantined, they will be re-directed to Perth where they are to make their own way home.   A Boeing 747 is being considered to take the evacuees but the aircraft is too big to land on the tarmac on Christmas Island.   Australians may be forced to land in Darwin before taken to the island on another plane.      Earlier, Mr Dutton defended the Christmas Island plan, saying it would help keep Australia safe.   'I
 can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 
people. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of 
people,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday.   Australians 
trapped in the Chinese Wuhan province will need to pay $1,000 in order 
to be evacuated to the detention centre on Christmas Island (pictured)   The deadly disease has killed 170 people in China and nine Australians have so far been diagnosed    What is this virus?    The
 virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses 
are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild lung 
infections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be 
deadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a 
coronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the 
early 2000s.    Can the Wuhan coronavirus kill?    Yes a 170 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.     What are the symptoms?    Some
 people who catch the Wuhan coronavirus may not have any symptoms at 
all, or only very mild ones like a sore throat or a headache.   Others may suffer from a fever, cough or trouble breathing.    And
 a small proportion of patients will go on to develop severe infection 
which can damage the lungs or cause pneumonia, a life-threatening 
condition which causes swelling and fluid build-up in the lungs.    How is it detected?    The
 virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China and 
countries around the world have used this to create lab tests, which 
must be carried out to confirm an infection.   Delays to these 
tests, to test results and to people getting to hospitals in China, mean
 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be just a fraction of the 
true scale of the outbreak.      How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified around China and are known to have spread from person to person.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries
 in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South
 Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia
 and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the 
UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.    Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?    Experts
 have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more 
than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere.    SCROLL DOWN TO SEE  MAILONLINE'S FULL Q&amp;A  ON THE CORONAVIRUS     Australian diplomats are continuing negotiations with Chinese authorities to clear the way for the 'humanitarian' mission.    But those facing the potential trip to Christmas Island aren't happy.   Bon
 Lee, a physiotherapist from Sydney is stuck in the Hubei province and 
fears the plane evacuation may put him at greater risk of contracting 
the disease.    'I just want to keep my options open. The main 
thing is safety for the people, my family, my patients. I also need to 
weigh up risks of going to Christmas Island,' he told the publication.   'It's
 great for quarantine to be far away from everything, but if something 
bad happens, the closest hospital is in Darwin 2700 kilometres away.'   Moko Yong from Melbourne has been trapped in Wuhan for more than a week and says he will refuse the government's plan.   'Many
 people expressed that they cannot accept the destination of evacuation 
accounted for by Australia. After all, Christmas Island, to many 
Chinese-Australians, we know what kind of place it is,' he 
said.     Christmas Island Shire president Gordon Thomson told  ABC News  the decision would turn the island into a 'leper colony'.   'Saw
 PM's announcement. Regressive colonial era ideas since 2001. Create 
convict settlement for innocent people - now we'll be a leper colony,' 
Mr Thomson said in a text message.    It is unclear how many 
evacuees will be put into quarantine on Christmas Island, which sits 
1,650 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia.    Prime 
Minister Scott Morrison said Australia was working with New Zealand on 
the operation and would seek to help Pacific nations evacuate their 
citizens where possible but his 'first priority right now is the safety 
of Australians'.   'I stress there is rather a limited window here 
and we are moving very, very swiftly to ensure we can put this plan 
together and put the operation together,' Morrison told reporters in 
Canberra.   'I stress that this will be done on a last-in, first-out basis.    'I
 want to stress that we cannot give a guarantee that this operation is 
able to succeed and I also want to stress very clearly that we may not 
be in a position if we're able to do this on one occasion to do it on 
another occasion.'    Foreign Minister Marise Payne said 
Australia was seeking permission from Chinese authorities to allow its 
citizens to depart Wuhan, with Australian consular officials travelling 
from Shanghai to coordinate the efforts.   Fully protected ambulance and medical staff walk through a community health station in Wuhan   A

 of people could have been exposed to the coronavirus in Australia by 
the country's nine confirmed patients alone - as up to 49,000 people 
land on flights from China per week and a global health emergency is 
declared.   Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus in recent weeks.   Each one flew in from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, on planes packed with hundreds of potential victims.   At least a day passed after they arrived before they developed flu-like symptoms and eventually went to hospital.   Thousands of people could have been exposed to coronavirus in Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone   A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, getting off the last flight to Australia from Wuhan
 before they were shut down   During this time when they 
didn't know they were sick, they interacted with hundreds of people 
each, some of whom could now be infected.     One patient 
was even allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day at a 
restaurant with his family while he was waiting for test results.   People
 they infected will be going about their lives on crowded trains and 
buses, having business meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing
 the virus on.   This is just from the nine confirmed cases - more 
than a dozen other people are being tested after developing symptoms 
associated with the virus.   It comes as China's coronavirus death toll hits 170 and the World Health Organisation declares a global health emergency.   Speaking
 to reporters, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: 
'The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is 
happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.   'Our
 greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries 
with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'   Russia,
 which has no cases of the virus, is closing its 2,600-mile border with 
China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard 
against the outbreak.   Train traffic between the countries was 
halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air 
traffic between the two countries continued.   On Thursday Israel 
banned all incoming flights from China and 6,000 people in Italy were 
prevented from leaving a cruise ship while tests were carried out on a 
passenger from Macau.   Australia and New Zealand are planning a 
joint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan while Singapore is setting up a 
quarantine facility on an island to the city's north-east.   Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus.    The
 man in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick 
from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city

Two
 arrived on direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney on separate China 
Eastern Airlines flight MU749, one on January 20 and another on an 
unknown date.   Both these flights had up to 250 passengers plus several crew on board who are prime candidates for infection.   Another
 man, diagnosed on the same day, flew in to Sydney via Shenzhen, near 
Hong Kong, on January 6 on a plane that carries up to 277 people.    NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   The fourth arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on a an A388 carrying up to 525 passengers.   A
 total of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in 
Australia from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the
 world.   Based on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have
 entered Australia from China since the deadly virus was first detected 
in Wuhan seven weeks ago.   On Thursday, major airlines suspended or
 reduced services to China including British Airways, Lufthansa, 
American Airlines, KLM, and United.   But the airlines that fly from
 China to Australia - including eight Chinese airlines and Qantas - made
 no changes to their routes, except for China Eastern cancelling its 
flight from Wuhan to Sydney last week.   The flights include 62 
planes from Guangzhou, 42 from Shanghai and 18 from Beijing per week, 
with direct routes to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and 
Darwin.   On Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the 
airline was considering scrapping its Sydney to Beijing route due to low
 demand.   The airline had already announced plans to axe that 
service from March, but Mr Joyce suggested that could happen 
sooner.     NSW Health advice states that people are at 
risk of catching the virus if they spent 15 minutes in close contact, 
such as a face-to-face conversation, or two hours in the same confined 
space.    Chinese health authorities have confirmed that, 
contrary to earlier belief, patients are contagious even before they 
develop symptoms.   On Monday, it was confirmed that a 21-year-old 
University of NSW student who arrived on a different MU749 flight 
was infected.   The university told students in an email that she 
became unwell soon after her flight and isolated herself in her 
on-campus dorm room for 24 hours before going to hospital.   UNSW is
 not in semester but there are still some students and staff on campus 
she could have interacted with, along with on public transport and at 
the airport.   Many students are terrified they could be infected 
next, especially with thousands of Chinese classmates due to arrive on 
campus in coming weeks.   The second Melbourne patient landed on 
January 21, though it is not clear which flight he was on, and wasn't 
diagnosed until Wednesday.   The man in his 60s went to hospital two days later but was allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day with his family.   He
 was with five family members - three adults and two children - at The 
House of Delight in Glen Waverley between 5.30pm and 7pm.   Victoria's
 chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton urged other diners to contact the 
health department and watch for coronavirus symptoms.   Other 
businesses in the same building as the restaurant on 52 Montclair 
Avenue have closed until February 9 and others are thinking about 
shutting up shop.   A cleaner was brought in to disinfect buttons in the building's lift.   One
 of the patient's adult relatives and one of the children have tested 
negative so far, and all five are in isolation with him.    The seventh victim has the most capacity to have infected hundreds of others.   The
 44-year-old Chinese tourist arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via 
Singapore on January 22 and spent several days travelling with a tour 
group.     On Thursday night it was confirmed that one of 
them, a 42-year-old woman, contracted the virus herself, while three 
others were sick.     All eight of his fellow holidaymakers are now in isolation with him at Gold Coast University Hospital.   They
 all took Tiger Air flight TT566, landing on the Gold Coast about 8pm on
 Monday on a plane that carries up to 189 passengers.   Queensland Health chief officer Dr Jeannette Young on Thursday said she was concerned about everyone on the plane.   Students at the University of NSW where a classmate was diagnosed with coronavirus say they are too afraid to go back to class   A
 21-year-old Chinese student was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this
 week after she flew back from Wuhan on January 23    'My
 concern is that those 150-200 people on that plane when he started 
getting symptoms and then his 24 hours in the Gold Coast community, I 
need to track exactly where he went,' she said.   Tiger Air said it 
was in the process of contacting the passengers and crew to notify them 
so they could visit their GP for testing.   The 44-year-old stayed 
at an apartment in the Oracle building in Broadbeach, which is in the 
same building as the $900-a-night Peppers hotel frequented by 
celebrities including Taylor Swift.   He became increasingly unwell 
after first developing symptoms before the flight out of Melbourne and 
called an ambulance about 3.30pm on Tuesday.     A Chinese tourist who arrived in Melbourne early last week was diagnosed on Thursday a week after she got sick.   Her
 exposure to the public is believed to be more limited as she spent the 
vast majority of her time with family members she was visiting.    Queensland's
 two confirmed coronavirus cases are a Chinese nationals - a man and a 
woman - from the same tour group that spent about six days in Melbourne 
before flying to the Gold Coast.   The man, 44, fell ill on Tiger 
Air flight TT566 from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on Monday night. He 
was travelling with eight other tourists, four of whom have fallen ill 
and were being tested for the virus.   A 42-year-old woman - who was
 part of the same tour group - was confirmed on Thursday night as 
Queensland's second coronavirus case.    WHAT WE KNOW    * The tour group came from Wuhan and stopped in Singapore before flying to Australia.   *They left Singapore on either January 21 or 22, and landed in Melbourne on January 22.   *The group spent the next five days in the Victorian capital touring the city.   *Authorities are now trying to track their movements and alert people who may have been in contact.   *The tour group boarded Tiger Air flight TT566 on January 27 at 7.44pm AEDT and landed at the Gold Coast Airport at 8.45pm AEST.   *The passenger was travelling on a booking with one other person and they were seated in 11A and 11B.   *The 44-year-old developed symptoms on the flight, which was carrying about 150-200 passengers.   *The man travelled to his Gold Coast hotel, before calling an ambulance. He spent less than 24 hours in the hotel.   *
 The man and four others from the tour group who developed symptoms have
 been isolated in the Gold Coast University Hospital.    An
 man infected with coronavirus visited The House Of Delight restaurant 
in Glen Waverley, Melbourne's south-east, with his five family members 
between 5.30pm and 7pm on January 26   Other businesses
 in the same building as the restaurant on 52 Montclair Avenue have 
closed until February 9 and others are thinking about shutting up 
shop    Nine people have contracted the virus after travelling to Australia from Hubei province in central China.   *
 The tally is four in NSW, three in Victoria and two in Queensland. Two 
of the NSW victims are no longer infectious and were discharged from 
hospital on Thursday. The others are all stable.   * The latest case
 is a 42-year-old Chinese woman who travelled from Wuhan to the Gold 
Coast via Melbourne. She is now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital.   *
 China's women's soccer team, which includes 32 players and staff,

 The federal government plans to evacuate Australians from the Hubei 
capital of Wuhan after about 600 citizens and residents registered for 
help to get out. China must approve the plan.   * They will be flown to Christmas Island and put in quarantine for two weeks.   *
 The federal health department has issued new advice amid evidence the 
virus has been spread by people before they develop any symptoms.   *
 Anyone who has recently been to Hubei or had contact with a confirmed 
case must isolate themselves at home for 14 days from the date of their 
departure.   THE WORLD:   * Some 170 people have died from the 
virus in mainland China, and the number of confirmed cases is now more 
than 7000. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei.   * Some major airlines have halted all flights to China, but so far Qantas is not among them.   *
 The virus is now affecting most of Australia's regional neighbours 
including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia.   TRAVEL WARNINGS:   * The Australian government is advising people to reconsider travel to China and not go to Hubei province.   (Sources: China's National Health Commission, Australian Chief Medical Officer and state chief health officers)    People the nine patients infected could pass the virus on to others before they even know they are sick or were exposed at all.   Scientists are still trying to fully understand this strain of coronavirus and work out how contagious it is and how to stop it.   The
 infection rate of diseases is called its basic reproduction number, 
known as R0 or r-nought, brought to public attention by 2011 film 
Contagion about a fictional worldwide pandemic.   Imperial College 
London estimated coronavirus' R0 to be 2.6, meaning that on average
 each patient would infect 2.6 others before they died, were isolated, 
or got better.   This number changes over time as the virus spreads

 score as high as 16, while SARS was 2 to 5, as is HIV, while a standard
 flu is about 1.3.   Some particularly deadly diseases, like ebola, 
have low scores because they kill patients too fast to infect many 
people, or produce symptoms too fast.   Coronavirus has a mortality 
rate of about 2 per cent, compared to 9.5 per cent for SARS and 
34.5 per cent in the 2012 MERS outbreak.   Australia is starting at a low base of infection, but this can quickly multiply if the average R0 observed in China is met.   Coronavirus has killed 170 so far, all in China, and more than 7,800 are infected worldwide.  "

 Australian man who has been trapped in Wuhan amid the deadly 
coronavirus outbreak has shared footage of his daring foray into the 
city to buy food after spending weeks in quarantine.     Daniel
 Ou Yang, from Sydney, is among the 600 Australians who remain stuck in 
the Chinese city after it was placed into lockdown to prevent the spread
 of the virus.      For two weeks, the 21-year-old, 
who was visiting his grandparents, has been unable to leave his home as 
residents have been told to not even open their doors.    Mr 
Yang stepped outside for the first time to buy food and necessities on 
Thursday, only to find empty shelves at the supermarket, deserted 
streets and few supplies left.    Scroll down for video     Daniel
 Ou Yang (pictured) was visiting his grandparents when he became trapped
 in the city after it was placed into lockdown to prevent the spread of 
the deadly virus   The 21-year-old from Sydney, shared a 
video of his foray into the city where he found empty shelves at the 
supermarket, deserted streets and little supplies    Mr Yang admitted he had been 'nervous' about venturing into ground zero of the deadly virus   He shared a video of his trip into the city which he described as an 'emotional' experience.    'We
 went for a supply run to get groceries and seeing my once bustling city
 streets empty, the people nervous, really breaks my heart,' he 
said.    'Most of the snacks, preserved food, meat, and 
sanitisers are out of stock on the shelves. We didn't even bother to 
look for masks. It was nice to get out of the house finally 
though.'    He admitted he had been 'nervous' about venturing 
into ground zero of the deadly virus saying people are 'hesitant to get 
close to you' and are 'wearing full body coverings.'      In an earlier video, he shared the view from his apartment, giving a bird's eye view of the ghost town.    'We've
 got two main roads on both sides of our apartment which is normally 
congested in traffic 24/7, and this is the first time we have ever seen 
it like this. My city has become a ghost town,' he said.    'All the light rails, buses, taxi services, trainsa| everything's stopped.'   Mr
 Yang first took to social media on Sunday to notify his friends and 
family that he had been quarantined in Wuhan, describing the alarming 
conditions.   The streets on Wuhan, the epicentre of China's deadly virus, are empty as the city is forced into lockdown   Mr
 Yang said he was desperate to get home to Sydney to see his girlfriend 
and get back to his real estate business but was not sure about the 
living conditions on Christmas Island if he's evacuated there   Some 170 people have died from the virus in mainland China and more than 7,000 have been infected worldwide    'The situation however is pretty bad over here, and it's worse than the government let's out.   'Our
 hospitals are full, and we are rushing to set up a brand new hospital 
in a week from now. Doctors are only taking emergency status patients, 
and anyone else are being turned away to self isolate at home.    'We are being advised to not even open our doors. There's definitely more infected and dead than what is being reported.'    More than 7,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, and some 170 have died.    Nine cases in Australia have been confirmed - four in NSW, three in Victoria and two in Queensland.    Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison announced a plan on Wednesday to evacuate 
Australians trapped at the epicentre of China's deadly virus and 
quarantine them on the remote island for 14 days.    Mr Yang 
found out about the evacuation through friends messaging him news 
articles after the prime minister made the announcement in Canberra.   Nine cases in Australia have been confirmed - four in NSW, three in Victoria and two in Queensland   Daniel
 Ou Yang is an Australian in the Chinese city of Wuhan and fearful of 
his uncertain future (stock image of Christmas Island)    He said he has not heard from the Australian government in four days.   But he admitted he was sceptical about the government's plans, fearing he would be treated as a 'detainee'.    'I know we would be kept in the detention centre and the treatment of detainees is not the best,' Mr Yang said.    On
 Thursday, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said images of the 
Christmas Island facility would be released in a bid to alleviate 
concerns about the centre's standards.   Priority will be given to the elderly and children and those who have been in Wuhan for the least amount of time.   If anyone has the disease they will be transferred to an Australian hospital, Mr Dutton said.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15           "

A
 Chinese woman in her 40s, a visitor from Hubei province, is in a stable
 condition with the respiratory illness, Victoria's Department of Health
 and Human Services confirmed.   She was confirmed positive on Thursday following a series of tests and has been isolated in the Royal Melbourne Hospital.   Two close contacts of the woman have been identified and are being monitored for symptoms.   It is still not clear which public places the woman had visited before feeling unwell.   This
 new case comes one day after the health department announced a man 
confirmed having the coronavirus dined with his family at a suburban 
Melbourne restaurant before being isolated.   The man in his 60s had become infected while travelling in China's Hubei province.   The
 department said the man started to feel unwell on January 23 and had 
remained isolated since then, but he had dinner with his family on 
Australia Day at The House Of Delight restaurant in Glen Waverley.   The
 man's three adult and two child relatives have been isolated with him. 
One has already tested negative for the virus, while the children are 
being kept from school.   Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Brett 
Sutton urged anyone who was at the restaurant between 5.30pm and 7pm on 
Australia Day to be aware of symptoms.   Although Dr Sutton said 
the restaurant was allowed to open, a sign outside the establishment 
says it will remain closed until February 9, ""in order to minimise the 
risk of the Novel Coronavirus"".   A Chinese New Year and Lantern 
Festival which was due to be held in Glen Waverley's Kingsway in 
February has also been cancelled, a Chinese events organising committee 
told Monash Council.     Advertisement    "

 researchers have been tasked with painting a clearer picture of the 
deadly new coronavirus, to pave the way for testing potential vaccines.   Federal
 science agency the CSIRO have been asked by a global group that aims to
 derail epidemics to help determine the key characteristics of the 
virus.   The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) 
wants to know how long the virus takes to develop and replicate, how it 
impacts the respiratory system and how it's transmitted.    The
 CSIRO is working with the Doherty Institute and the University of 
Queensland with the goal to develop a vaccine in a matter of 
weeks.    Dr Mike Catton and Dr Julian Druce from the 
Doherty Institute. The Australian laboratory was the first in the world 
to replicate the virus outside China    Scientists
 working in the secure area at CSIRO's Australian Animal Health 
Laboratory (AAHL), a high-containment facility in Geelong     Dr
 Julian Druce from the Doherty Institute which is now working with the 
CSIRO and the University of Queensland to develop a vaccine    The
 CSIRO will conduct the research at the Australian Animal Health 
Laboratory, a high-containment facility in Victoria's Geelong.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The
 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      It is the only physical containment laboratory of its kind in Australia and one of just five in the world.   Once
 they know more about the virus - which has killed more than 200 people 
in China where it surfaced - CSIRO scientists can begin testing vaccines
 developed by a CEPI-led consortium.   The consortium - which 
includes both CSIRO and the University of Queensland - was established 
in hopes of speeding up the time taken to develop potential vaccines 
from years to weeks.   CSIRO chief executive Dr Larry Marshall says 
the organisation is uniquely placed to help fight the virus, given its 
capabilities in animal and human health, genetics, data and machine 
learning.   'As the national science agency, we can help bring 
together every branch of science and experts from across the system to 
tackle this major global health challenge, he said.    The 
development comes two days after researchers at the Peter Doherty 
Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne became the first 
scientists to recreate the virus outside China.   Emergency 
personnel are seen in full hazmat gear entering Peppers hotel on the 
Gold Coast on Tuesday. Two individuals were seen waiting with face masks
 escorted  paramedics to their friend inside the hotel, after 40 
mins the patient was taken to University Hospital    Foreign Minister Marise Payne issued a travel warning on Wednesday, advising Australians to stay away from Hubei    The
 lab-grown virus - which was developed from the first patient diagnosed 
in Australia - will help with accurately diagnosing the disease around 
the world.     The Doherty Institute was the second lab to
 grow the virus after one in China cultivated it last week. The Chinese 
lab, however, only released the genome sequence, meaning labs around the
 world still did not have a physical sample.   Growing the virus is 
important for developing a vaccine because scientists can now test how 
it behaves. Scientists can also generate an antibody test, which can be 
used to detect the virus in patients without symptoms.   The CSIRO 
says it is collaborating both with the Peter Doherty Institute and the 
University of Queensland, where trials have begun to develop a vaccine.   The
 coronavirus death toll has risen to 204 and the World Health 
Organisation has declared the disease a public health emergency.   The total number of people infected in Australia rose to nine after two new cases were confirmed on Thursday evening.    Health
 Minister Greg Hunt warned the disease is of 'pandemic potential' and 
the number of cases in the country is expected to rise as more are 
tested every day.   'There are a number of cases being considered in
 each of the states and territories, those numbers will literally change
 by the hour because some will be cleared and others will be tested,' he
 told Sky News.   'We do believe that there is a potential for 
further cases to be identified and therefore, to be announced. At this 
stage, the latest advice is that all five patients are being treated in 
isolation and all are stable and being well cared for.   'We have 
some of the strongest border protection measures in place around the 
world and we have biosecurity officials boarding all planes from China 
looking for symptoms.   'The Prime Minister has ordered all planes 
coming from China are boarded by security officials and that's an 
extremely important measure.   'Every passenger is met with by 
biosecurity officials and not only are they provided with information, 
but there is a review of their symptoms and the situation.'   Foreign Minister Marise Payne issued a travel warning on Wednesday, advising Australians to stay away from Hubei.

The patients, who were treated at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, have safely recovered and are no longer infectious.   Health
 Minister Greg Hunt confirmed their release in a press conference on 
Friday afternoon - as he ruled out banning flights from China to 
Australia.   Thousands of people could have been exposed to coronavirus in Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone   Flat-out: Exhausted health professionals in the Chinese province of Hubei where the coronavirus is spreading    Members of a medical team prepare to leave for Wuhan in Hubei Province on 27 January to help treat patients   He
 said: 'We still have two in New South Wales that are being treated here
 at Westmead Hospital. The other two that were being housed here have 
been released after it was determined that they were medically clear to 
go home.'   Mr Hunt also said that preparations are under way on 
Christmas Island which will house Australian citizens who request to be 
evacuated from Wuhan, where the virus was first detected on 12 December.   There are around 600 still in China's Hubei province - but it is not known how many will request evacuation.   'I
 have spoken with the director of the National Critical Care and Trauma 
Centre this morning and he has confirmed they have a team of 24 and the 
first members of those will arrive today,' he said.   Ministers do 
not yet know when Australians can be evacuated from China because 
negotiations are still ongoing with Beijing.    The plan is to 
fly them to Christmas Island off WA and keep them quarantined until they
 are safe to return to the Australian mainland.   Up to 49,000 
people land on flights from China per week but Australian Chief Medical 
Officer Brendan Murphy said there were no plans to stop the planes.   He
 said: 'The World Health Organization strongly recommends that nations 
do not ban flights from China because unless you lockdown exit from the 
country, banning direct flights, doesn't stop people coming from 
China.    'They could come from all sorts of other ports and at
 least we know who is coming from China and we can meet and do very 
intensive border measures for those flights.'   Meanwhile, there are
 fears thousands of people could have been exposed to the coronavirus in
 Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone.    Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus in recent weeks.   Each one flew in from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, on planes packed with hundreds of potential victims.   At least a day passed after they arrived before they developed flu-like symptoms and eventually went to hospital.   A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, getting off the last flight to Australia from Wuhan
 before they were shut down    The
 executive director of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response 
Centre, Professor Len Notaras said the doctors, nurses and allied health
 officials being sent to Christmas Island were of the 'highest calibre' 
and were being drawn from every state and territory.    A demountable hospital will be set up including diagnostic and protective equipment and negative pressure facilities.   However,
 Prof Notaras told reporters in Darwin it was important to note those 
people who will be placed in isolation were not sick at this stage and 
would likely not become sick.   He said they would not be held in detention, although their movements would be restricted.   Should
 any begin to show symptoms or become seriously ill the medical team on 
the island would make the initial call on their continued treatment.   Anyone
 who became critically ill would likely be repatriated to Australia, 
possibly to WA or to a hospital close to where they live, Prof Notaras 
said.   Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia's actions were 
driven by medical advice, and the World Health Organisation was strong 
in its support for quarantine measures to stem the spread of the virus.   'Our
 job is to protect Australians and provide support for citizens overseas
 and the best way to do that is to find a place which was designed to 
deal with people who were coming (from) overseas ... and to do that in a
 way which is humane,' Mr Hunt said.   Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton defended the Christmas Island plan, saying it would help keep Australia safe.   'I
 can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 
people. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of 
people,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday.   Christmas Island 
administrator Natasha Griggs said residents had expressed some concerns 
but had been assured that all necessary measures had been put in place 
to ensure the safety of locals.   'By and large, the Christmas 
Island residents understand that this is a humanitarian mission and 
they're generally supportive,' she said.   'We've got a fantastic 
team of people that have got experience in doing this, a track record of
 success so the residents of Christmas Island have no need to worry.'   But
 Australian Medical Association boss Tony Bartone said there were better
 alternatives to sending evacuees to Christmas Island, with some medical
 specialists suggesting the Woodside army barracks near Adelaide and 
another facility just north of Katherine in the NT.    During
 this time when they didn't know they were sick, they interacted with 
hundreds of people each, some of whom could now be infected.     One
 patient was even allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day at
 a restaurant with his family while he was waiting for test results.   People
 they infected will be going about their lives on crowded trains and 
buses, having business meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing
 the virus on.   This is just from the nine confirmed cases - more 
than a dozen other people are being tested after developing symptoms 
associated with the virus.   It comes as China's coronavirus death toll hits 170 and the World Health Organisation declares a global health emergency.   Speaking
 to reporters, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: 
'The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is 
happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.   'Our
 greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries 
with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'   Russia,
 which has no cases of the virus, is closing its 2,600-mile border with 
China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard 
against the outbreak.   Train traffic between the countries was 
halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air 
traffic between the two countries continued.   On Thursday Israel 
banned all incoming flights from China and 6,000 people in Italy were 
prevented from leaving a cruise ship while tests were carried out on a 
passenger from Macau.   Australia and New Zealand are planning a 
joint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan while Singapore is setting up a 
quarantine facility on an island to the city's north-east.   Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus.    The
 man in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick 
from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city
 that is the epicentre of the outbreak.    Shoppers cover

 total of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in 
Australia from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the
 world.   Based on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have
 entered Australia from China since the deadly virus was first detected 
in Wuhan seven weeks ago.   On Thursday, major airlines suspended or
 reduced services to China including British Airways, Lufthansa, 
American Airlines, KLM, and United.   But the airlines that fly from
 China to Australia - including eight Chinese airlines and Qantas - made
 no changes to their routes, except for China Eastern cancelling its 
flight from Wuhan to Sydney last week.   The flights include 62 
planes from Guangzhou, 42 from Shanghai and 18 from Beijing per week, 
with direct routes to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and 
Darwin.   On Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the 
airline was considering scrapping its Sydney to Beijing route due to low
 demand.   The airline had already announced plans to axe that 
service from March, but Mr Joyce suggested that could happen 
sooner.     NSW Health advice states that people are at 
risk of catching the virus if they spent 15 minutes in close contact, 
such as a face-to-face conversation, or two hours in the same confined 
space.    Chinese health authorities have confirmed that, 
contrary to earlier belief, patients are contagious even before they 
develop symptoms.   On Monday, it was confirmed that a 21-year-old 
University of NSW student who arrived on a different MU749 flight 
was infected.   The university told students in an email that she 
became unwell soon after her flight and isolated herself in her 
on-campus dorm room for 24 hours before going to hospital.   UNSW is
 not in semester but there are still some students and staff on campus 
she could have interacted with, along with on public transport and at 
the airport.   Many students are terrified they could be infected 
next, especially with thousands of Chinese classmates due to arrive on 
campus in coming weeks.   The second Melbourne patient landed on 
January 21, though it is not clear which flight he was on, and wasn't 
diagnosed until Wednesday.   The man in his 60s went to hospital two days later but was allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day with his family.   He
 was with five family members - three adults and two children - at The 
House of Delight in Glen Waverley between 5.30pm and 7pm.   Victoria's
 chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton urged other diners to contact the 
health department and watch for coronavirus symptoms.   Other 
businesses in the same building as the restaurant on 52 Montclair 
Avenue have closed until February 9 and others are thinking about 
shutting up shop.   A cleaner was brought in to disinfect buttons in the building's lift.   One
 of the patient's adult relatives and one of the children have tested 
negative so far, and all five are in isolation with him.    The seventh victim has the most capacity to have infected hundreds of others.   The
 44-year-old Chinese tourist arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via 
Singapore on January 22 and spent several days travelling with a tour 
group.     On Thursday night it was confirmed that one of 
them, a 42-year-old woman, contracted the virus herself, while three 
others were sick.     All eight of his fellow holidaymakers are now in isolation with him at Gold Coast University Hospital.   They
 all took Tiger Air flight TT566, landing on the Gold Coast about 8pm on
 Monday on a plane that carries up to 189 passengersQueensland Health 
chief officer Dr Jeannette Young on Thursday said she was concerned 
about everyone on the plane.  "

49,000 people are landing in Australia on 167 flights from China, where 
170 are dead from coronavirus and more than 7,700 infected. Many are 
heading to holidays spots such as Queensland's Gold Coast (pictured)   Many
 of those arriving are heading to holidays spots such as the Gold Coast,
 visiting family and friends in suburban Sydney and Melbourne or 
returning to east coast universities.   But first they must come 
through the international airports, where checks have already been 
rolled out for those arriving from all Chinese cities.    The 
Australian cities hit hardest so far by coronavirus are the three most 
popular tourist destinations for Chinese tourists: Sydney, Melbourne and
 the Gold Coast.   Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus which emerged from China in recent weeks.    Sydney,
 Melbourne and Brisbane airports welcome 90 per cent of Chinese visitors
 to Australia and those cities - in that order - host the most Chinese 
university students.   Public concern about coronavirus in Australia
 has centred on places where those who have recently travelled from 
China are most likely to have passed through or congregate.   Sydney's
 Hurstville, Chatswood and Burwood and Melbourne's Box Hill and Glen 
Waverley have some of the highest concentrations of 
Chinese-Australians.    An man infected with coronavirus
 visited The House Of Delight restaurant at Glen Waverley in Melbourne's
 south-east with five family members on January 26. Glen Waverley has 
one of Australia's largest Chinese populations   Students
 at the University of New South Wales where a 21-year-old classmate was 
diagnosed with coronavirus on Monday say they are too afraid to go back 
to class   Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services 
is gathering information on potential coronavirus public exposure sites 
after a third case surfaced in that state.    Thousands of 
people could have already been exposed to coronavirus by Australia's 
nine confirmed infected patients in three states.   Each one flew in
 from Wuhan in China's Hubei province where the outbreak began, on 
planes packed with hundreds of potential victims.    China is 
Australia's largest source of tourists and the top tourism destinations 
for visitors are Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast.   Tourism Australia figures reveal 1,442,341 visits from China to Australia in the past year.    The three biggest eastern seaboard capital city airports account for 151 of the 167 flights from China to Australia each week.   Sydney takes 83, Melbourne 52 and Brisbane 16, followed by Cairns with six, Adelaide and Perth with four and two into Darwin.   Flight
 attendants wear protective face masks at Brisbane Airport on Friday.

including two in Queensland   Passengers at Brisbane

 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk claimed on Friday the federal government 
had not given the states enough information about who had entered the 
country.   'I don't know at the moment, in Queensland, where people 
from the Hubei province actually are because the Federal Government has 
that information,' Ms Palaszczuk said.   'If we donat have the information, we cannot contain this virus.'   Prime
 Minister Scott Mr Morrison responded: 'There would not be an issue the 
Commonwealth knows that the Queensland government does not.'   The 
most common causes for travel are tourism (770,954), education (272,348)
 and visiting friends and family (270,914) followed by business (72,165)
 and employment (21,288).   Chinese visitors to Australia spent 
almost $12billion in the past year and major shopping centres in Sydney,
 Melbourne and the Gold Coast are popular attractions.   'In 
order to minimize the risk of the Novel Coronavirus, our restaurant is 
closed from 29th January, 2020 to 9th February, 2020. Sorry for any 
inconvenience'   Research done in 2018 found 15 per cent of 
Chinese tourists on holidays of more than 30 days visited Sydney's 
Chatswood Chase shopping centre three or more times.   Victoria's 
leading shopping centre for Chinese tourists was the QV Centre in 
Melbourne's central business district while in Queensland it was the 
Gold Coast's Pacific Fair.   China is the largest source of 
international university students in Australia and they make up 22 per 
cent of all Chinese-born people in Australia.   On Monday it was confirmed a 21-year-old University of NSW student who arrived on a flight from Wuhan flight was infected.    Many
 students fear they too could be infected, with thousands of Chinese 
classmates due to arrive on campus and start their studies in coming 
weeks.    The latest ABS figures show there are 152,591 Chinese
 students enrolled in Australia, which is 38 per cent of all overseas 
enrollments.   Most are in NSW (58,510), Victoria (50,878) and 
Queensland (17,686), followed by South Australia (8,701), the ACT 
(8,538), Western Australia (5,328), Tasmania (2,762) and the Northern 
Territory (188).   The top six Australian suburbs with the most 
residents born in China are Hurstville (NSW), inner city Melbourne 
(Victoria), Glen Waverley (Victoria), Burwood (NSW), Campsie (NSW) and 
Chatswood (NSW).    Thousands of people could have been exposed to coronavirus in Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone   A
 21-year-old Chinese student at the University of New South Wales was 
diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this week after she flew back from 
Wuhan on January 23    Of the patients infected with 
coronavirus in Australia at least a day passed after they arrived from 
China before they developed flu-like symptoms and eventually went to 
hospital.    During this time when they didn't know they were 
sick they each likely interacted with hundreds of people, some of whom 
could now be infected.    One patient was even allowed out of 
isolation to celebrate Australia Day at a restaurant with his family 
while he was waiting for test results.   People they infected will 
be going about their lives on crowded trains and buses, having business 
meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing the virus on.   This
 is just from the nine confirmed cases - more than a dozen other people 
are being tested after developing symptoms associated with the virus.   Australia
 and New Zealand are planning a joint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan 
while Singapore is setting up a quarantine facility on an island to the 
city's north-east.   A pamphlet handed out by the Australian Government providing travellers with information on the deadly coronavirus (pictured)   In Australia, the first men were confirmed to be infected with coronavirus on January 25 - three in NSW and another in Victoria.   Two
 arrived on direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney on separate China 
Eastern Airlines flight MU749, one on January 20 and another on an 
unknown date.   Both these flights had up to 250 passengers plus several crew on board who are prime candidates for infection.   Another
 man, diagnosed on the same day, flew in to Sydney via Shenzhen, near 
Hong Kong, on January 6 on a plane that carries up to 277 people.    NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

QUEENSLAND: 2      January 29      January 30       SOUTH AUSTRALIA   : 2     February 1       A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital.   The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   The fourth arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on a an A388 carrying up to 525 passengers.   A
 total of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in 
Australia from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the
 world.   Based on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have
 entered Australia from China since the deadly virus was first detected 
in Wuhan seven weeks ago.   On Thursday, major airlines suspended or
 reduced services to China including British Airways, Lufthansa, 
American Airlines, KLM, and United.   But the airlines that fly from
 China to Australia - including eight Chinese airlines and Qantas - made
 no changes to their routes, except for China Eastern cancelling its 
flight from Wuhan to Sydney last week.   The flights include 62 
planes from Guangzhou, 42 from Shanghai and 18 from Beijing per week, 
with direct routes to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and 
Darwin.   On Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the 
airline was considering scrapping its Sydney to Beijing route due to low
 demand.   The airline had already announced plans to axe that 
service from March, but Mr Joyce suggested that could happen 
sooner.     NSW Health advice states that people are at 
risk of catching the virus if they spent 15 minutes in close contact,

others on public transport and at the airport.   The second 
Melbourne patient landed on January 21, though it is not clear which 
flight he was on, and wasn't diagnosed until Wednesday.   The man in his 60s went to hospital two days later but was allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day with his family.   He
 was with five family members - three adults and two children - at The

 44-year-old Chinese tourist arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via 
Singapore on January 22 and spent several days travelling with a tour 
group.     On Thursday night it was confirmed that one of 
them, a 42-year-old woman, contracted the virus herself, while three 
others were sick.     All eight of his fellow holidaymakers are now in isolation with him at Gold Coast University Hospital.   They
 all took Tiger Air flight TT566, landing on the Gold Coast about 8pm on
 Monday on a plane that carries up to 189 passengers.   Queensland Health chief officer Dr Jeannette Young on Thursday said she was concerned about everyone on the plane.   'My
 concern is that those 150-200 people on that plane when he started 
getting symptoms and then his 24 hours in the Gold Coast community, I 
need to track exactly where he went,' she said.   Tiger Air said it 
was in the process of contacting the passengers and crew to notify them 
so they could visit their GP for testing.   The 44-year-old stayed 
at an apartment in the Oracle building in Broadbeach, which is in the 
same building as the $900-a-night Peppers hotel frequented by 
celebrities including Taylor Swift.   He became increasingly unwell 
after first developing symptoms before the flight out of Melbourne and 
called an ambulance about 3.30pm on Tuesday.     A Chinese tourist who arrived in Melbourne early last week was diagnosed on Thursday a week after she got sick.   Her
 exposure to the public is believed to be more limited as she spent the 
vast majority of her time with family members she was visiting.    Nine people have contracted the virus after travelling to Australia from Hubei province in central China.   *
 The tally is four in NSW, three in Victoria and two in Queensland. Two 
of the NSW victims are no longer infectious and were discharged from 
hospital on Thursday. The others are all stable.   * The latest case
 is a 42-year-old Chinese woman who travelled from Wuhan to the Gold 
Coast via Melbourne. She is now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital.   *
 China's women's soccer team, which includes 32 players and staff, 
remains in isolation at a Brisbane hotel after arriving on Wednesday.   *
 The federal government plans to evacuate Australians from the Hubei 
capital of Wuhan after about 600 citizens and residents registered for 
help to get out. China must approve the plan.   * They will be flown to Christmas Island and put in quarantine for two weeks.   *
 The federal health department has issued new advice amid evidence the 
virus has been spread by people before they develop any symptoms.   *
 Anyone who has recently been to Hubei or had contact with a confirmed 
case must isolate themselves at home for 14 days from the date of their 
departure.   THE WORLD:   * Some 170 people have died from the 
virus in mainland China, and the number of confirmed cases is now more 
than 7000. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei.   * Some major airlines have halted all flights to China, but so far Qantas is not among them.   *
 The virus is now affecting most of Australia's regional neighbours 
including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia.   TRAVEL WARNINGS:   * The Australian government is advising people to reconsider travel to China and not go to Hubei province.

 Health Minister Greg Hunt saying contact details for those on board had
 been passed onto Queensland Health, Ms Raworth said she was not 
notified and the only contact she has had with the agency has been her 
calling them.    'My producer called up and asked a few 
question like 'what flight were you on on Monday night?' and that's
 when I learnt that the person that tested positive for coronavirus was 
also travelling on that flight with me,' Ms Raworth told  Today .    Maggie
 Raworth (pictured) was on board Tigerair flight TT566 from Melbourne

 don't really know what to do, I've been told a few different things. I 
called Queensland Health and they told me I was at risk and I needed to

department only to be informed there was a low risk of infection and she
 should carry about her business as usual.    Ms Raworth said 
she was told to leave work but is concerned because she had been 
interviewing people throughout the week.     More than 150 people were on board flight TT556.     The
 two passengers with coronavirus on the flight are Chinese nationals who
 had been part of a tour group from the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of

Hundreds
 of security workers fear they will catch the deadly new coronavirus by 
coming into close contact with passengers who may be infected.   They say they want to wear protective masks but have been stopped by their bosses over fears they will alarm travellers.   Security
 staff at Australia's international airports are threatening to walk off
 the job if bosses don't let them wear masks (stock image)    Flight attendants wear protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport on 31 January   The United
 Workers Union has threatened to 'ground every flight in the country' by
 telling security workers to strike if their demands are not met.   The union says that some workers who demanded masks have been threatened with disciplinary action.    Neva Woolmer of the United Workers Union warned workers may be forced to strike.   'Staff
 are hoping it will not come to that but their health and safety is very
 important to them,' she told Daily Mail Australia.   A spokesman 
added: 'If the health and safety needs of these workers are not 
met, United Workers Union will direct members to cease work even if it 
means grounding every flight in the country.'    A Sydney Airport spokesman said 'security and cleaning contractors are closely following the advice from health authorities'.   'Additionally,
 they have made personal protective equipment like face masks, gloves 
and hand sanitiser available to any employee who wises to use them,' he 
said.    Flight attendants wear protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport on 31 January   Passengers wear protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport on 31 January   It
 comes as two patients with coronavirus have been released in New South 
Wales while seven people remain hospitalised around Australia.   The patients, who were treated at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, have safely recovered and are no longer infectious.   Health
 Minister Greg Hunt confirmed their release in a press conference on 
Friday afternoon - as he ruled out banning flights from China to 
Australia.   He said: 'We still have two in New South Wales that are
 being treated here at Westmead Hospital. The other two that were being 
housed here have been released after it was determined that they were 
medically clear to go home.'   Mr Hunt also said that preparations 
are under way on Christmas Island which will house Australian citizens 
who request to be evacuated from Wuhan, where the virus was first 
detected on 12 December.   Flat-out: Exhausted health professionals in the Chinese province of Hubei where the coronavirus is spreading    Members of a medical team prepare to leave for Wuhan in Hubei Province on 27 January to help treat patients   There are around 600 still in China's Hubei province - but it is not known how many will request evacuation.   'I
 have spoken with the director of the National Critical Care and Trauma 
Centre this morning and he has confirmed they have a team of 24 and the 
first members of those will arrive today,' he said.   Ministers do 
not yet know when Australians can be evacuated from China because 
negotiations are still ongoing with Beijing.    The plan is to 
fly them to Christmas Island off WA and keep them quarantined until they
 are safe to return to the Australian mainland.   Up to 49,000 
people land on flights from China per week but Australian Chief Medical 
Officer Brendan Murphy said there were no plans to stop the planes.   He
 said: 'The World Health Organization strongly recommends that nations 
do not ban flights from China because unless you lockdown exit from the 
country, banning direct flights, doesn't stop people coming from 
China.    'They could come from all sorts of other ports and at
 least we know who is coming from China and we can meet and do very 
intensive border measures for those flights.'   Meanwhile, there are
 fears thousands of people could have been exposed to the coronavirus in
 Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone.    Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus in recent weeks.   Each one flew in from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, on planes packed with hundreds of potential victims.   At least a day passed after they arrived before they developed flu-like symptoms and eventually went to hospital.   A
 passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney 
Airport on Thursday, getting off the last flight to Australia from Wuhan
 before they were shut down    The
 executive director of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response 
Centre, Professor Len Notaras said the doctors, nurses and allied health
 officials being sent to Christmas Island were of the 'highest calibre' 
and were being drawn from every state and territory.    A demountable hospital will be set up including diagnostic and protective equipment and negative pressure facilities.   However,
 Prof Notaras told reporters in Darwin it was important to note those 
people who will be placed in isolation were not sick at this stage and 
would likely not become sick.   He said they would not be held in detention, although their movements would be restricted.   Should
 any begin to show symptoms or become seriously ill the medical team on 
the island would make the initial call on their continued treatment.   Anyone
 who became critically ill would likely be repatriated to Australia, 
possibly to WA or to a hospital close to where they live, Prof Notaras 
said.   Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia's actions were 
driven by medical advice, and the World Health Organisation was strong 
in its support for quarantine measures to stem the spread of the virus.   'Our
 job is to protect Australians and provide support for citizens overseas
 and the best way to do that is to find a place which was designed to 
deal with people who were coming (from) overseas ... and to do that in a
 way which is humane,' Mr Hunt said.   Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton defended the Christmas Island plan, saying it would help keep Australia safe.   'I
 can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 
people. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of 
people,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday.   Christmas Island 
administrator Natasha Griggs said residents had expressed some concerns 
but had been assured that all necessary measures had been put in place 
to ensure the safety of locals.   'By and large, the Christmas 
Island residents understand that this is a humanitarian mission and 
they're generally supportive,' she said.   'We've got a fantastic 
team of people that have got experience in doing this, a track record of
 success so the residents of Christmas Island have no need to worry.'   But
 Australian Medical Association boss Tony Bartone said there were better
 alternatives to sending evacuees to Christmas Island, with some medical
 specialists suggesting the Woodside army barracks near Adelaide and 
another facility just north of Katherine in the NT.    During
 this time when they didn't know they were sick, they interacted with 
hundreds of people each, some of whom could now be infected.     One
 patient was even allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day at
 a restaurant with his family while he was waiting for test results.   People
 they infected will be going about their lives on crowded trains and 
buses, having business meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing
 the virus on.   This is just from the nine confirmed cases - more 
than a dozen other people are being tested after developing symptoms 
associated with the virus.   It comes as China's coronavirus death toll hits 170 and the World Health Organisation declares a global health emergency.   Speaking
 to reporters, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: 
'The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is 
happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.   'Our
 greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries 
with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'   Russia,
 which has no cases of the virus, is closing its 2,600-mile border with 
China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard 
against the outbreak.   Train traffic between the countries was 
halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air 
traffic between the two countries continued.   On Thursday Israel 
banned all incoming flights from China and 6,000 people in Italy were 
prevented from leaving a cruise ship while tests were carried out on a 
passenger from Macau.   Australia and New Zealand are planning a 
joint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan while Singapore is setting up a 
quarantine facility on an island to the city's north-east.   Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus.    The

Two
 arrived on direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney on separate China 
Eastern Airlines flight MU749, one on January 20 and another on an 
unknown date.   Both these flights had up to 250 passengers plus several crew on board who are prime candidates for infection.   Another
 man, diagnosed on the same day, flew in to Sydney via Shenzhen, near 
Hong Kong, on January 6 on a plane that carries up to 277 people.    NEW SOUTH WALES: 4    Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman.

QUEENSLAND: 2      January 29      January 30       SOUTH AUSTRALIA   : 2     February 1       A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital.   The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia.   SA
 Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed 
symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test.   Australia
 has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of 
Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei 
province.    Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless 
people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that 
part of China, there is no need for current concern.   The fourth arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on a an A388 carrying up to 525 passengers.   A
 total of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in 
Australia from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the
 world.   Based on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have
 entered Australia from China since the deadly virus was first detected 
in Wuhan seven weeks ago.   On Thursday, major airlines suspended or
 reduced services to China including British Airways, Lufthansa, 
American Airlines, KLM, and United.   But the airlines that fly from
 China to Australia - including eight Chinese airlines and Qantas - made
 no changes to their routes, except for China Eastern cancelling its 
flight from Wuhan to Sydney last week.   The flights include 62 
planes from Guangzhou, 42 from Shanghai and 18 from Beijing per week, 
with direct routes to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and 
Darwin.   On Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the 
airline was considering scrapping its Sydney to Beijing route due to low
 demand.   The airline had already announced plans to axe that 
service from March, but Mr Joyce suggested that could happen 
sooner.     NSW Health advice states that people are at 
risk of catching the virus if they spent 15 minutes in close contact, 
such as a face-to-face conversation, or two hours in the same confined 
space.    Chinese health authorities have confirmed that, 
contrary to earlier belief, patients are contagious even before they 
develop symptoms.   On Monday, it was confirmed that a 21-year-old 
University of NSW student who arrived on a different MU749 flight 
was infected.   The university told students in an email that she 
became unwell soon after her flight and isolated herself in her 
on-campus dorm room for 24 hours before going to hospital.   UNSW is
 not in semester but there are still some students and staff on campus 
she could have interacted with, along with on public transport and at 
the airport.   Many students are terrified they could be infected 
next, especially with thousands of Chinese classmates due to arrive on 
campus in coming weeks.   The second Melbourne patient landed on 
January 21, though it is not clear which flight he was on, and wasn't 
diagnosed until Wednesday.   The man in his 60s went to hospital two days later but was allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day with his family.   He
 was with five family members - three adults and two children - at The 
House of Delight in Glen Waverley between 5.30pm and 7pm.   Victoria's
 chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton urged other diners to contact the 
health department and watch for coronavirus symptoms.   Other 
businesses in the same building as the restaurant on 52 Montclair 
Avenue have closed until February 9 and others are thinking about 
shutting up shop.   A cleaner was brought in to disinfect buttons in the building's lift.   One
 of the patient's adult relatives and one of the children have tested 
negative so far, and all five are in isolation with him.    The seventh victim has the most capacity to have infected hundreds of others.   The
 44-year-old Chinese tourist arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via 
Singapore on January 22 and spent several days travelling with a tour 
group.     On Thursday night it was confirmed that one of 
them, a 42-year-old woman, contracted the virus herself, while three 
others were sick.     All eight of his fellow holidaymakers are now in isolation with him at Gold Coast University Hospital.   They
 all took Tiger Air flight TT566, landing on the Gold Coast about 8pm on
 Monday on a plane that carries up to 189 passengersQueensland Health 
chief officer Dr Jeannette Young on Thursday said she was concerned 
about everyone on the plane.  "

 coronavirus outbreak could rapidly get worse and become even deadlier 
as it continues to spread worldwide, a leading Australian virologist has
 warned.   Professor Trevor Drew is the director of the CSRIO's 
Australian Animal Health Laboratory in regional Victoria, where 
fast-tracked efforts to develop a vaccine for the virus are now 
underway.   His chilling warning comes as a Qantas jet waits on 
standby to fly to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus which is in 
lockdown, where around 600 Australians are stranded.   Just over a quarter of those Australians have registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs to be evacuated.   People wearing protective face masks to protect themselves from Coronavirus are seen at Brisbane International Airport   Thousands of people could have been exposed to coronavirus in Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone   The jet is expected fly to Wuhan as soon as Chinese authorities give the all clear.   The
 plane could leave the virus-stricken city as early as Monday morning, 
when it will then fly stranded Australians to Christmas Island, where a 
disaster response team has already been sent.   They will stay at a 
quarantine centre on the island 2,600 kilometres from the mainland for 
two weeks before they return home.    Professor Drew told  The Australian  previous research in pigs showed how coronavirus could become more lethal over time.   He
 said the contagion needs to be regarded as a 'cloud' of closely 
matched pathogens rather than one virus with the potential to become 
even deadlier in 'a 'high-host-density environment' such as China.   'You may well find that more virulent viruses emerge from that cloud,' Professor Drew said.    'What
 I am thinking might be happening here is not that people have been 
infected for some time with this virus, but that it is finding a new 
niche rather more slowly and that could ultimately cause more of a 
problem than we have seen with other diseases because it is not so 
spectacular early on in its evolution.'   Professor Drew said Chinese authorities have recognised the outbreak could be worse than the SARS epidemic in 2003.   Professor
 Drew is leading the fast-tracked development of a coronavirus vaccine 
at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, a high-containment facility 
in Geelong.   It is the only physical containment laboratory of its kind in Australia and one of five in the world.   Preclinical trials could be underway by March and  a vaccine developed within four months.    'Our
 role is to take the knowledge that we will be gaining from how this 
virus behaves and then creating the biological platforms that are 
necessary for developing and trialling vaccine candidates,' CSIRO

213.    The virus, which emerged late last year, has infected thousands in China with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone.   Authorities
 have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of the city of 11million, 
blocking off roads out and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus 
spreading    Australia's gateways, major tourist destinations, 
universities and suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne with large numbers of 
Chinese have emerged as the frontline in the fight against the deadly 
virus.     Fears are held thousands of Australians could 
have been unwittingly exposed to the virus in airplanes, restaurants and
 shopping centres by nine confirmed infected patients.   Late on 
Friday, Melbourne's Monash University announced it will postpone 
orientation week and delay the start of semester one classes by a week 
due to the 'unprecedented situation' of Astudents and staff unable to 
return in time from overseas.    Originally due to start on 
March 2, all week one classes from March 9 will be provided online with 
physical on campus teaching will commence the following week, the 
university's website states.   'We understand many in the Monash 
community will be concerned about the novel coronavirus. We're committed
 to adapting our university operations to ensure the health safety of 
our community,' the website states.   Up to 49,000 people are landing in Australia on 167 flights from China each week.    Many
 of those arriving are heading to holidays spots such as the Gold Coast,
 visiting family and friends in suburban Sydney and Melbourne or 
returning to east coast universities.   But first they must come 
through the international airports, where checks have already been 
rolled out for those arriving from all Chinese cities.    The 
Australian cities hit hardest so far by coronavirus are the three most 
popular tourist destinations for Chinese tourists: Sydney, Melbourne and
 the Gold Coast.   Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus which emerged from China in recent weeks.    Sydney,
 Melbourne and Brisbane airports welcome 90 per cent of Chinese visitors
 to Australia and those cities - in that order - host the most Chinese 
university students.   Public concern about coronavirus in Australia
 has centred on places where those who have recently travelled from 
China are most likely to have passed through or congregate.   Sydney's
 Hurstville, Chatswood and Burwood and Melbourne's Box Hill and Glen 
Waverley have some of the highest concentrations of 
Chinese-Australians.     Authorities are closely watching 
key meeting places around the country for signs of outbreaks of 
coronavirus as the World Health Organisation declares a global public 
health emergency. Shoppers are pictured at a seafood market in Sydney's 
Cabramatta    An man infected with coronavirus

 of Australia's largest Chinese populations   Victoria's 
Department of Health and Human Services is gathering information on 
potential coronavirus public exposure sites after a third case surfaced 
in that state.    Thousands of people could have already been 
exposed to coronavirus by Australia's nine confirmed infected patients 
in three states.   Each one flew in from Wuhan in China's Hubei 
province where the outbreak began, on planes packed with hundreds of 
potential victims.    China is Australia's largest source of 
tourists and the top tourism destinations for visitors are Sydney, 
Melbourne and the Gold Coast.   Tourism Australia figures reveal 1,442,341 visits from China to Australia in the past year.    The three biggest eastern seaboard capital city airports account for 151 of the 167 flights from China to Australia each week.   Sydney takes 83, Melbourne 52 and Brisbane 16, followed by Cairns with six, Adelaide and Perth with four and two into Darwin.   Flight
 attendants wear protective face masks at Brisbane Airport on Friday. 
There have been nine confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, 
including two in Queensland   Passengers at Brisbane 
Airport wear protective masks as the coronavirus is declared a global 
health emergency. Brisbane welcomes 16 flights from China each week   Queensland
 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk claimed on Friday the federal government 
had not given the states enough information about who had entered the 
country.   'I don't know at the moment, in Queensland, where people 
from the Hubei province actually are because the Federal Government has 
that information,' Ms Palaszczuk said.   'If we don't have the information, we cannot contain this virus.'   Prime
 Minister Scott Mr Morrison responded: 'There would not be an issue the 
Commonwealth knows that the Queensland government does not.'   The 
most common causes for travel are tourism (770,954), education (272,348)
 and visiting friends and family (270,914) followed by business (72,165)
 and employment (21,288).   Chinese visitors to Australia spent 
almost $12billion in the past year and major shopping centres in Sydney,
 Melbourne and the Gold Coast are popular attractions.     What is the coronavirus?      A
 coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and 
people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to 
reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses 
are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they
 are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The 
coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this 
outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on
 Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed 
around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 
'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named 
after it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr
 Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a 
family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species 
including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild 
animals.    'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there 
were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of 
these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has 
been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and 
result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).    'Coronaviruses
 are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another 
and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new 
coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet 
known.'     The first human cases were publicly reported 
from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people 
live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on 
December 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had 
been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were 
developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The
 first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 
cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 
people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.      Where does the virus come from?    According
 to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from 
bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the 
similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet 
cats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came 
from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which 
has since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market 
is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being
 sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, 
porcupines and camel meat.    A study by the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific 
journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in 
patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found 
in bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so 
scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a 
middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a 
human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr
 Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not 
involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places 
the origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether
 another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, 
and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host 
might have been.'      So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?     Experts
 say the international community is concerned about the virus because so
 little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It
 is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 
in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus 
which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which
 killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for
 COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any 
immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This 
means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across 
often, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in 
January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel 
viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which
 circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most
 seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 
1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand
 fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate 
could be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.    'My
 feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this 
iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The
 illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, 
making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even
 before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the 
saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, 
kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live
 on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning 
people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,
 people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in 
Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been 
there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to 
person.     What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once
 someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 
days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still
 be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, 
typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever 
(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from 
these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an 
infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with 
fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing 
that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the
 virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to 
flu, but it is not clear why.       What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?         Scientists
 in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of 
the virus and released them to experts working around the world.    This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.      Examinations
 have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known 
as mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,
 the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it 
spread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and 
to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus 
might look different every time scientists analyse it.      More
 study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small 
number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were
 various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed 
separately.    How dangerous is the virus?      The
 virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death 
rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 
50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning
 of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are 
infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded 
cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they 
never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more 
serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it 
really is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr
 Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a 
mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only 
showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be 
accurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured?     The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics
 do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral
 drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then 
developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge 
amounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and 
it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this 
outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National 
Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, 
say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about 
coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But 
this may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,
 governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and
 to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People
 who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their 
symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected 
public.   And airports around the world are putting in place 
screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's 
temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot 
those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,
 it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small 
likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?       The
 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by 
the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new 
disease'.    Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside 
of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't 
actually spreading actively around the world.   'In
 order to minimize the risk of the Novel Coronavirus, our restaurant is 
closed from 29th January, 2020 to 9th February, 2020. Sorry for any 
inconvenience'   Research done in 2018 found 15 per cent of 
Chinese tourists on holidays of more than 30 days visited Sydney's 
Chatswood Chase shopping centre three or more times.   Victoria's 
leading shopping centre for Chinese tourists was the QV Centre in 
Melbourne's central business district while in Queensland it was the 
Gold Coast's Pacific Fair.   China is the largest source of 
international university students in Australia and they make up 22 per 
cent of all Chinese-born people in Australia.   On Monday it was confirmed a 21-year-old University of NSW student who arrived on a flight from Wuhan flight was infected.    Many
 students fear they too could be infected, with thousands of Chinese 
classmates due to arrive on campus and start their studies in coming 
weeks.    The latest ABS figures show there are 152,591 Chinese
 students enrolled in Australia, which is 38 per cent of all overseas 
enrollments.   Most are in NSW (58,510), Victoria (50,878) and 
Queensland (17,686), followed by South Australia (8,701), the ACT 
(8,538), Western Australia (5,328), Tasmania (2,762) and the Northern 
Territory (188).   The top six Australian suburbs with the most 
residents born in China are Hurstville (NSW), inner city Melbourne 
(Victoria), Glen Waverley (Victoria), Burwood (NSW), Campsie (NSW) and 
Chatswood (NSW).    A pamphlet handed out by the Australian Government providing travellers with information on the deadly coronavirus (pictured)   Of
 the patients infected with coronavirus in Australia at least a day 
passed after they arrived from China before they developed flu-like 
symptoms and eventually went to hospital.    During this time 
when they didn't know they were sick they each likely interacted with 
hundreds of people, some of whom could now be infected.    One 
patient was even allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day at a
 restaurant with his family while he was waiting for test results.   People
 they infected will be going about their lives on crowded trains and 
buses, having business meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing
 the virus on.   This is just from the nine confirmed cases - more 
than a dozen other people are being tested after developing symptoms 
associated with the virus.    In Australia, the first men were confirmed to be infected with coronavirus on January 25 - three in NSW and another in Victoria.   Two
 arrived on direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney on separate China 
Eastern Airlines flight MU749, one on January 20 and another on an 
unknown date.   Both these flights had up to 250 passengers plus several crew on board who are prime candidates for infection.   Students
 at the University of New South Wales where a 21-year-old classmate was 
diagnosed with coronavirus on Monday say they are too afraid to go back 
to class   Another man, diagnosed on the same day, flew in to 
Sydney via Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, on January 6 on a plane that 
carries up to 277 people.   The fourth arrived in Melbourne from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on a an A388 carrying up to 525 passengers.   A
 total of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in 
Australia from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the
 world.   Based on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have
 entered Australia from China since the deadly virus was first detected 
in Wuhan seven weeks ago.    The UK first declared its first 
cases of the coronavirus earlier today and the country is now on high 
alert for more possible infections.    Two people believed to be Chinese tourists staying in York are now being treated at Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.   Meanwhile, President
 Donald Trump dismissed six US cases of coronavirus as a 'very little 
problem' on Thursday in an effort to reassure the American public 
despite the World Health Organization's declaration that the outbreak is
 a global health emergency.      The new coronavirus 
spreading from China has also spread from one infected person who 
visited China to another who had not been to the outbreak's 
epicenter.    As a result of both developments, the US State 
Department has issued its strictest travel warning, advising Americans 
not to go to China, where more than 200 people have died an nearly 
10,000 are sick with the new disease.   A 21-year-old Chinese
 student at the University of New South Wales was diagnosed with 
coronavirus earlier this week after she flew back from Wuhan on January

 claimed another mother slapped her in the face and threatened to 'pull 
her mouth off'.   The woman, known only as Maggie, is covered in 
black bruises after being battered by another irate mother who took 
offence to her views on the virus.   She claims another mother 
arrived at her Brookvale home and attacked her while her husband and 
six-year-old on watched on in horror.    Both women were taken to hospital with injuries after the physical fight which took place on Tuesday at around 8pm.    The
 row started after Maggie criticised a woman for not going into 
quarantine after returning from Wuhan a Northern Beaches Facebook 
group.    Northern Beaches Police shared the story to their Facebook on Thursday, where it quickly went viral (pictured)   Wuhan is the epicentre of the fatal virus, which has killed more than 200 people and infected nine Australians.    One
 mother took offence to Maggie's views and arrived outside her home 
after another person posted Maggie's address on the group.     Maggie told the  Daily Telegraph  she thought they were meeting 'for a chat' but it soon turned violent.        'She
 said ""Iall pull your mouth off"", and I said, ""I donat want to waste my 
time with you"" - then she slapped me,' she said.     'We pulled each otheras hair and fell to the floor.'    Maggie
 claimed she tried to defend herself, but the aggressive woman snapped 
off her gold necklace, which cut her neck.     Two women have ended up in hospital after an online argument over the coronavirus turned violent (stock image)   The
 woman, aged 33 and 36, decided to settle their argument about the 
coronavirus each bringing with friend for support.     'The
 argument quickly escalated from verbal to physical; pushing, slapping, 
hair pulling and finally both on the ground, briefly unconscious, all 
despite the efforts of bystanders trying to intervene,' police 
said.    The two women accompanying them, who were also from the group chat, tried to separate the pair.   The 36-year-old required a scan for a possible brain injury and was treated for a shoulder injury and a cut to her arm.   So far nine Australians have tested positive for the coronavirus, amid fears the virus could soon spread across the country   The
 younger woman underwent X-rays for a shoulder injury as well as 
treatment for cuts, bruising and swelling to her arms, upper body and 
neck.   Police have taken out a Personal Violence Order for one of the women as investigations continue.   Both women have since been released from hospital.   Facebook users were quick to comment, with many suggesting the women weren't setting a good example for their kids.    'Bloody
 hell! How dumb can people be? Let's hope that both of them knocked some
 sense into each other because that's appalling behaviour,' one person 
wrote.   'Now I know why I avoid mother's groups.'

 legend and anti-vaxxer Anthony Mundine has claimed the coronavirus is 
fake and a 'ploy' to allow for the introduction of a 'mass 
vaccine'.      The outbreak has killed more than 200 people in  China  and there are almost 10,000 confirmed cases of the virus.    But
 the 44-year-old former rugby star said he didn't think the virus was 
'real' in a bizarre Facebook post on Saturday morning.   Boxing legend Anthony 'The Man' Mundine has claimed the coronavirus is fake   The former rugby star made the brazen comments in a bizarre Facebook rant on Saturday morning   'I don't even think this Coronavirus is real,' he wrote.    'I think it's a ploy to give a mass vaccine look into it.'    Mundine has previously shared anti-vaccination sentiments on his social media profile.       His
 latest controversial comments divided his fans, with many claiming 
'Choc' should only comment on things he knows, like boxing.    'Anthony I am a strong supporter but you need to stick to what you have knowledge of,' one person said.    'Come on Choc. You're smarter than that mate. It's not as bad as made out but it's real,' said another.    Some
 suggested Mundine should visit Wuhan - the 11-million-strong epicentre 
of the outbreak - to see for himself.       The deadly outbreak has killed more than 200 people in China and there are almost 10,000 confirmed cases of the virus   Thousands of people could have been exposed to coronavirus in Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone   Mundine's
 latest controversial comments divided his fans, with many claiming 
'Choc' should only comment on things he knows like boxing. 'Anthony
 I am a strong supporter but you need to stick to what you have 
knowledge of,' one person said   'If it's not real, can you take a weekend trip to Wuhan for us then?' one wrote.    Other social media users could see some of Mundine's logic.   'I think that the spread was deliberate to create worldwide hysteria, hence vaccine sales,' one said.   Vaccinations
 are a simple, safe and effective way of protecting people against 
harmful diseases before they come into contact with them, the Australian
 government says.    The jabs protect individuals and others in the community, by reducing the spread of preventable diseases.     Source:    Australian Government      'There's
 more to it than they're telling us, it doesn't smell right and those 
who believe everything we're told are naive and gullible,' said 
another.    In April last year, Mundine urged his followers not to vaccinate their children.    'Don't vaccine your kids period! (sic) The government bully (sic) you into vaccine!' he wrote.   'Do your research on the (sic) s**t &amp; watched (sic) the documentary vaxxed.'   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison quickly slammed Mundine's claims and said the 
boxer was putting children at risk.      'We immunise
 our kids so there's a herd immunity that actually protects very 
vulnerable people in this country,' he told Fox FM after being asked 
about Mundine's comments.   'I started that when I was Social 
Services Minister - introducing the no-jab no-play rules that went into 
our childcare centres and preschools.'   In April last year, 
Mundine urged his followers not to vaccinate their children. 'Don't 
vaccine your kids period! (sic) The government bully (sic) you into

slammed Mundine's claims and said the boxer was putting children at risk   The
 World Health Organisation has declared coronavirus, which has killed 
more than 200 people in China and infected thousands, a public health 
emergency.   The declaration means there will be a greater focus on a
 global response, with WHO fearful of what could happen if the virus 
reaches countries ill-prepared to cope with high infection rates.   'Australia has been acting in advance of this decision,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.   'All
 of the issues - isolation, case management, contract tracing, 
prevention of onward spread, active surveillance, early detection - 
Australia has been doing.'   Human coronavirus with pandemic 
potential is a listed human disease under Australian laws, which enables
 the government to use 'enhanced border measures' to contain 
outbreaks.    The virus has spread to 18 countries including Australia, which has had nine confirmed cases with more expected.   Hong Kong has closed its borders to mainland China.   Flight attendants wear face masks to protect themselves from coronavirus at Brisbane International Airport   Wuhan was put into lock-down last Thursday, amid growing fears over the rapid spread of the deadly virus.    The
 government is poised to evacuate stranded Australians stuck in Wuhan as
 soon as it gets the green light from Chinese officials.    It's
 anticipated China will approve the evacuation over the weekend, 
meaning stranded Australians could leave Wuhan in the early hours of 
Monday morning.    Evacuees will be flown back to Australia 
first before being taken to Christmas Island in smaller aircraft. They 
will then be quarantined on the detention centre for 14 days.    Anti-vaxxing is generally considered dangerous and leaves communities vulnerable to diseases like measles.   The Australian government recommends immunising children to protect them against harmful diseases.    'Immunisation
 not only protects individuals, but also others in the community, by

 fourth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Victoria, as health 
authorities wait on more than a dozen other test results for the deadly 
illness.   A Melbourne woman, aged in her 20s, became ill after 
flying home from Wuhan a week ago, but health authorities say she was 
not infectious en route and is recovering in isolation at home.   It
 comes as Monash University pushes back its start date for the first 
semester by a week as a precaution against the spread of the virus.   ""We've
 had to make some difficult decisions for the safety and wellbeing of 
our staff, students and the wider community,"" the university said in a 
tweet on Friday.   It comes after the World Health Organisation 
declared the virus a public health emergency and ahead of the evacuation
 of Australians stranded at the epicentre of the outbreak to Christmas 
Island.   More than 250 people have died in China so far and nearly 12,000 cases are confirmed, that country's state media says.   Back in Victoria, authorities are waiting on 13 test results for coronavirus after giving 149 people the all-clear.   The latest confirmed patient became ill two days after arriving home on January 25.   She was seen by doctors at a Melbourne hospital five days later before being cleared to recover at home.   Since
 then, the woman has remained in isolation and had no visitors so 
authorities do not believe she has exposed others to the virus.     Advertisement    "

 servant Malcolm Scriber and his family, who live in Hobart, were on 
holiday visiting relatives in the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan when 
the city was put under quarantine on January 23.    Since then,
 Mr Scriber, his mother June, his wife Wenjuan and their two children 
Luna, 11 months, and Eli, 3, have been trapped in a small apartment 
owned his Chinese-born partner's family.    The Australian Government is offering a $1,000-a-head evacuation flight with  Qantas  but Mr Scriber doesn't see the point in spending money to put his family at risk.     Malcolm
 Scriber (left), his Chinese-born wife Wenjuan (right), their two young 
children and mother June have been trapped in a small Wuhan apartment 
since January 23. They will not board a government evacuation flight for
 fear they will be exposed to coronavirus   Speaking to  The Australian ,
 Mr Scriber said: 'I don't like the idea of being in a confined space 
with a bunch of possibly ill people for 11 hours, or however long it 
would take.   'And I don't like the idea of being in the detention 
centre. I'd rather stay somewhere where I'm comfortable and make it home
 when I can make it home.'   Mr Scriber's mother June, who lives 
next door to him in Hobart, agrees with her son and is waiting it out 
with the rest of the family in Wuhan.     'Iam not sure 
how Iad make my way to the airport and then spend $1,000 to go to 
Christmas Island. People on the plane could Apotentially have the 
virus,' she told the publication.    The Scriber family are 
five of the estimated 450 Australians who are taking their chances in 
Wuhan rather than making the journey home.   Australians that are making the trip will  spend two weeks in a Christmas Island detention centre in isolation before being allowed onto the mainland.     Malcolm's
 mother June Scriber (pictured) agreed with her son that it was safer to
 stay in Wuhan. 'Iam not sure how Iad make my way to the airport 
and then spend $1,000 to go to Christmas Island. People on the plane 
could Apotentially have the virus,' she said.    The 
Scribers were midway through their holiday when the quarantine began and
 planned to return to Hobart in February for 11-month-old Luna's first 
birthday.    Now, young Luna will celebrate her birthday in a 
cramped apartment in central Wuhan - a city with a population of 11 
million which has become a ghost town.     Mr Scriber's wife wants to be close to her family, who live in Wuhan, as the city battles the virus.    At
 least 259 people have died and 11,791 people have been infected by the 
disease in China while there are 10 confirmed cases in Australia.    On

 is a precautionary measure following the most recent advice around the 
timeframe that people are contagious before showing symptoms.'    Dr
 Young said directly communicating with families who have travelled to 
China will help the state respond effectively to the coronavirus 
situation and to contain possible further spread.   The text 
messages, which were sent on Saturday, were in English and have also 
been translated into both simplified and traditional Chinese.    Queensland Health urges those who become unwell to visit their GP practice or the Emergency Department.    'The

 coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and 
people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to 
reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses 
are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they
 are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The 
coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this 
outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on
 Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed 
around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 
'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named 
after it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr
 Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a 
family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species 
including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild 
animals.    'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there 
were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of 
these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has 
been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and 
result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).    'Coronaviruses
 are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another 
and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new 
coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet 
known.'     The first human cases were publicly reported 
from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people 
live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on 
December 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had 
been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were 
developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The
 first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 
cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 
people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.      Where does the virus come from?    According
 to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from 
bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the 
similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet 
cats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came 
from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which 
has since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market 
is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being
 sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, 
porcupines and camel meat.    A study by the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific 
journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in 
patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found 
in bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so 
scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a 
middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a 
human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr
 Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not 
involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places 
the origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether
 another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, 
and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host 
might have been.'      So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?     Experts
 say the international community is concerned about the virus because so
 little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It
 is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 
in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus 
which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which
 killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for
 COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any 
immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This 
means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across 
often, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in 
January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel 
viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which
 circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most
 seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 
1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand
 fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate 
could be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.    'My
 feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this 
iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The
 illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, 
making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even
 before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the 
saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, 
kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live
 on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning 
people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,
 people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in 
Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been 
there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to 
person.     What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once
 someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 
days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still
 be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, 
typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever 
(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from 
these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an 
infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with 
fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing 
that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the
 virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to 
flu, but it is not clear why.       What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?         Scientists
 in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of 
the virus and released them to experts working around the world.    This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.      Examinations
 have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known 
as mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,
 the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it 
spread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and 
to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus 
might look different every time scientists analyse it.      More
 study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small 
number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were
 various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed 
separately.    How dangerous is the virus?      The
 virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death 
rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 
50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning
 of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are 
infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded 
cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they 
never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more 
serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it 
really is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr
 Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a 
mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only 
showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be 
accurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured?     The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics
 do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral
 drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then 
developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge 
amounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and 
it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this 
outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National 
Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, 
say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about 
coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But 
this may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,
 governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and
 to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People
 who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their 
symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected 
public.   And airports around the world are putting in place 
screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's 
temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot 
those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,
 it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small 
likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?       The
 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by 
the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new 
disease'.    Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside 
of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't 
actually spreading actively around the world.  "

frankly, if they're considering a holiday at the moment to reconsider 
whether an outbound overseas trip is what they want to do.'   He urged people to consider travelling to regional Australia rather than booking a trip overseas.   Mr Dutton said holidaying in Australia could also help businesses in areas struggling because of the bushfire crisis.   He
 also said Australians who are still in China need to think about 
leaving the country as soon as possible, with all flights temporarily 
suspended from February 9.   'If people are leaving Australia to go 
to China today against the advice then they're putting themselves in a 
difficult position,' he said.   'The very strong advice from the Federal Government is please, do not travel, let us assess this over the next 14 days.'   People are seen leaving the Sydney Airport terminal wearing facemasks over fears of the deadly coronavirus   A

 Sunday travellers coming to Australia from mainland China will have 
their visas cancelled - with 71 already cancelled overnight.    Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison announced on Saturday that foreign 
travellers who passed through mainland China will be barred from 
Australia in a desperate effort to prevent the outbreak from spreading 
further.   Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families will be exempt from the strict measures.   It also extends to airline staff who have used personal protective gear.   These
 individuals arriving out of mainland China, not just the Hubei 
province, are required to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the 
time they leave the country.    The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that the government needs to prepare as a domestic outbreak is possible.    WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Dalea said there is a possibility the virus could spread in countries other than China.   While most cases so far have been people who visited China, he warned it could spread within Australia,  ABC  reported.    'Countries
 need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases 
as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak 
control, if that happens,' Mr Galea said.     Mr Dutton said holidaying in Australia could also help businesses in areas struggling because of the bushfire crisis    Fully protected ambulance and medical staff walk through a community health station in Wuhan   The

 of Saturday, all travellers arriving out of mainland China are being 
asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they depart 
the country.   'In addition to that, there'll be advanced screening

Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it was a mistake to say they would be charged.   'The
 Department of Foreign Affairs have publicly said they they provided 
incorrect information,' he told ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.   The
 department had previous said the charge was consistent with the 
arrangements that were in place when people airlifted out of Cairo

Minister Peter Dutton had told Sky News evacuees would be charged $1000,
 as Prime Minister Scott Morrison had said last week.   Australians

 Mr Frydenberg said Beijing has yet to agree to the evacuation that 
would see Australians quarantined on Christmas Island.   'We're working through the issues, but we hope that approval is imminent,' the treasurer said.   Mr
 Morrison announced on Saturday foreign travellers who have left or 
passed through China will be denied entry to Australia aiming to stop 
the spread of the coronavirus.   Australian citizens, permanent 
residents and their immediate families, dependents, legal guardians and 
spouses, will be exempted from the strict measures, Mr Morrison said.   People
 who arrive in Australia and have been to mainland China, not just the 
Hubei province, are required to self-isolate for a period of 14 days 
from the time they left the country.   He also announced advanced screening arrangements at major airports.   Mr
 Dutton said border and medical staff having been working through the 
night to set up these arrangements to deal with travellers from China.   Australians
 trapped in the Chinese Wuhan province will need to pay $1,000 in order 
to be evacuated to the detention centre on Christmas Island (pictured)   He said staff conducting the screening that commenced from 6am on Sunday will be well protected.   Arriving travellers will be issued with masks and information and tested with thermometers.   'It
 provides additional reassurance to the Australian public that we are 
absolutely determined to deal with this issue,' Mr Dutton said.   'We
 have been decisive in making these decisions to get us to this point 
and we'll do what ever is necessary to keep Australians safe.'   These
 measures came as South Australia confirmed two new coronavirus cases 
there - a Chinese couple in their 60s - bringing the national total to 
12.   Australians are also being told not to travel to mainland China as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows.   The deadly disease has killed 170 people in China and nine Australians have so far been diagnosed   People

restrictions imposed the United States, Singapore and other countries 
will impact crews working across the airline's international 
network.    Mr Frydenberg also said it is too soon to judge what impact the cirus will have on the Australian economy.   He
 said China is a critical economic partner for Australia and the source 
of over 200,000 foreign students and 1.4 million tourists and provide a 
combined $16 billion to the economy.   'It's too early to give a 
definite view about the economic impact because we don't know how severe
 and how sustained the virus outbreak is,' the treasurer said.   He 
said the SARS virus in 2003 did impact on student numbers and tourist 
numbers fell about 11 per cent in the June quarter of that year, and 
while trade numbers were affected, they rebounded in subsequent quarter.   But he declined to speculate whether the economy could face a quarter of economic contraction.   'There are things that we can control and things that we can't control,' he said.   'When
 it comes to the outbreak of the virus, when it comes to the fires, when
 it comes to the floods. When it comes to the trade tensions between the
 United States and China, we can't control those factors.'

The
 large male was filmed striking its flippers together off the coast of 
the Farne Islands, near Northumberland, during the breeding season in 
2017.   While captive seals can be seen clapping in zoos and 
aquariums, scientists say this is the first time one of their wild 
counterparts has been caught on camera performing the action.   While humans clap to applaud or express approval, in the case of wild grey seals , this gesture signifies quite the opposite.   Scientists believe male seals clap to demonstrate  their strength ,
 as part of an attempt to ward off competitors and attract potential 
mates. The action produces a aloud high-frequency noisea, sending out aa
 clear signala to other males in the area.   In the video, the male seal can be seen swimming close to a female, with other males lurking nearby, before it starts clapping.   Dr
 Ben Burville, a researcher at Newcastle University who took the 
footage, said: aThe effect of the clap was instant and the rival males 
rapidly dispersed.   aThe clap was incredibly loud and at first I found it hard to believe what I had seen.a   Burville,
 who had been trying for many years to capture clapping seals on camera,
 added: aIave heard the distinctive shotgun-like cracks many times over 
the years and I felt sure this clapping behaviour was the source, but 
filming the seals in action has eluded me for 17 years.a   The video is part of an international study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science.   Dr
 David Hocking, from Monash University in Australia, who led the study, 
said: aThe discovery of aclapping sealsa might not seem that surprising,
 after all, theyare famous for clapping in zoos and aquaria.   aBut 
where zoo animals are often trained to clap for our entertainment a 
these grey seals are doing it in the wild of their own accord.a   The
 researchers say understanding more about grey seals and other marine 
life could help protect the species against the harmful effects of 
pollution.   Hocking added: aClapping appears to be an important 
social behaviour for grey seals, so anything that disturbed it could 
impact breeding success and survival for this speciesa.   aC/ This

 crisis has infected more than 14,000 people globally, the use of face 
masks has become part of daily life in Australian cities and other parts
 of the world.   Its effectiveness in preventing the spread of the virus, however, has been questioned by health experts.   Officials in  China  have required that people wear face masks when they go out in public places to prevent the spread of infection.   But
 a report by Work Safety claims the best preventive measures out of the

 as it happened with the use of face masks to prevent air pollution from
 the bushfires, surgical masks are not fitted to stop inhaling smaller 
airborne particles that might carry the virus.    For that 
reason, the report claims, respirators offer more protection although 
they can make it more difficult for a person to breathe.    People
 with symptoms are encouraged to stay in isolation and wear a face mask 
when in the same room as another person to reduce the risk of virus 
transmission.   NSW Health said people with respiratory infections 
should keep away from other people, wash hands with soap and running 
water for 20 seconds and avoid contact with others.      Surgical Masks    Are the kind worn by surgeons during operations.   Protect the wearer against large droplets or splashes of bodily and infected fluids from others.   Do not prevent a person from inhaling smaller airborne particles.   Are loose-fitting and when the wearer inhales, there is potential for particles to leak in or out of the sides.   Are not considered 'respiratory protection'.    Respirators      Are designed to prevent most small particles from entering the nose and mouth area.   Recommended for healthcare professionals treating patients infected by coronavirus.

The report comes days after pharmacies around Australia sold out of face masks and hand sanitisers.    Chemist
 Warehouse stores contacted by Daily Mail Australia in Melbourne,

way to stop disease spread is hygiene.   'It's (face masks) not 
necessarily the mask that's going to be the solution for them a there's 
other things that they can do,' he told the ABC.   'Keep up that 
hand hygiene, and by that it's just making sure we're always washing our

 government is standing firm on its request for a fee from their 
citizens looking to leave Wuhan, as the coronavirus outbreak continues.   The
 Australian government axed a proposed $1000 fee from those seeking 
refuge from the Chinese city, ahead of their uplift on Monday.   But
 prime minister Jacinda Ardern defended her government's choice to 
charge its citizens $NZ500 ($483AUD) - as well as any Australians or 
Pacific Islanders - seeking a route to New Zealand.   'I think 
that's just a recognition that these are families and individuals who 
would otherwise be paying privately to be returned back,' she 
said.    New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has 
defended her decision to charge Kiwi citizens stuck in Wuhan for rescue 
amid the coronavirus outbreak   'It's certainly not anywhere near the cost ... it goes towards some partial recovery.   'I haven't had anyone raise it with me that it's an issue.'   Around
 80 New Zealanders have expressed an interest in the 
government-chartered Air New Zealand flight, with some Australians also 
involved in the Kiwi uplift.   While Australians on board the Qantas
 flight are bound for remote Christmas Island, where they'll be 
quarantined for a fortnight, the New Zealand flight is headed to 
Auckland.   Once on home soil, they'll be taken to Whangaparaoa, a

 Chinese consul general in Auckland, Ruan Ping, said he was 'very 
disappointed' that New Zealand had made a decision to bar travelers from
 China, as many other countries have done.   Ardern said she was not worried about negative sentiment towards China from the ban.   'This is short term and temporary. We'll be reviewing every 48 hours,' she said.   'I do want to acknowledge the role the Chinese government has played in trying to contain transmission, it has been incredible.

 of Chinese students were reportedly detained by border force officials 
and had their belongings confiscated after the Morrison government 
instituted a travel ban in response to the coronavirus outbreak.   Citing senior university sector sources,  the Australian reported on Tuesday morning  that
 a group of about 70 students was intercepted at Sydney airport, with 
smaller numbers also detained after arriving in Melbourne and Brisbane.   aThese
 reports are very Adisturbing and have been the subject of discussions 
with government today. We expect swift action to remedy the situation,a 
the Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, told the 
Australian.   The newspaper said some students had already been en 
route to Australia before the travel ban was announced. The department 
of home affairs has been contacted for comment.   It comes as some 
Australian universities delay their semester return while others are 
offering special consideration for students unable to get back to 
Australia amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.   Universities have 
been scrambling to put in place policies and support for students and 
staff dealing with the coronavirus and the  travel ban put in place by the federal government  on Saturday.   There
 has not been a coordinated response from universities, and their 
policies will largely depend on when each university is to begin the 
semester.   The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona 
Jackson, said on Sunday that the focus was on the health and safety of 
people at university, and on minimising the disruption to their studies.   Monash
 University in Melbourne announced on Friday it would delay the start of
 semester one by one week, now due to start 9 March, along with summer 
exams, due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus making it 
difficult for students to get back to Australia, or out of isolation 
after arriving from China.   The University of Sydney announced on 
Saturday evening it would allow students to enrol up to two weeks after 
the start of semester (by 9 March), or let students defer their studies 
or have fees refunded.   For the University of New South Wales, 
where one student tested positive for coronavirus, students can defer 
their study if affected, and the university will consider late enrolment
 until the end of February. The university has said it will also 
consider allowing students to take courses online.   Queensland 
University of Technology has said returning students can seek a leave of
 absence if they cannot return by the end of week two, while new 
students unable to travel from China can defer their studies.   The University of Tasmania has said it will offer online courses to the estimated 1,300 students affected by the travel ban.   The
 Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and University of Adelaide 
among others who have said classes will continue as normal, but have 
encouraged affected students to contact them directly.   China 
represents the biggest market for Australiaas international student 
trade, at $12.1bn out of the $37.3bn in the 2018-19 financial year, 
according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.   It is 
not just the travel ban and isolation period that will affect students 
enrolling in Australian universities from China, after the countryas 
national education examinations authority last week  cancelled English language testing  in February for students planning to study abroad.   Given
 the changing response to coronavirus in global attempts to contain the 
spread, it is still difficult to quantify the economic impact it will 
have on the university sector. If the disruption to studying in the wake
 of the coronavirus continues throughout the first half of this year, it
 could cost between $6bn and $8bn, according to Phil Honeywood, chief 
executive of the International Education Association of Australia .   Last
 month the education minister Dan Tehan set up a global reputation 
taskforce chaired by Honeywood to determine the impact the bushfires 
would have on the international student market, and it has now had its 
remit expanded to cover the impact from the coronavirus.   The 
taskforce met for the first time on Monday and it is expected to suggest
 to universities a more consistent response to the coronavirus outbreak.   Honeywood
 said the taskforceas immediate focus would be to get care packages sent
 out to support those students in Australia who have had to isolate 
themselves for 14 days after returning from China.   aThere is a 
danger in all of this, and we havenat seen it so far, in racial 
profiling, and for Chinese students sitting alone in a four-metre square
 room wondering what lifeas like having to be by yourself for 14 days,a 
he said. aYou want to know that people are thinking of you and caring 
for you.a  "

 of foreigners who may have been exposed to the potentially deadly

 centre of Sydney, a source close to the operation has revealed.    Staff involved in the Australian Government's quarantine operation on  Christmas  Island claim security guards from Serco - the company that deploys staff at the  immigration  detention - have been sent to a Sydney hotel to oversee the operation.   The
 source told Daily Mail Australia four Chinese nationals had been held 
in rooms in isolation at the hotel - which cannot be identified for 
legal reasons - and that number was predicted to rise to 80 by the end 
of the week.    'Anyone who came in contact with or travelled through the contaminated areas could be held,' the source said.     Operation

deadly coronavirus are set to be secretly held in isolation at a hotel 
in Sydney, sources reveal. Pictured: Airline staff heading back to

 Daily Mail Australia that security company Serco has booked 'several 
rooms' at the hotel, which is popular with airline staff, but denied 
claims foreigners were already being quarantined inside them   If any of those held in isolation show signs of coronavirus, they will be taken to hospital.   The
 revelations come as 243 of the approximately 600 Australians stranded 
in the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan, in Hubei province, left on a 
specially-chartered Qantas flight to be taken to Christmas Island for 
two weeks of quarantine.    The virus has infected more than 
17,000 people - including 12 in Australia - and has been declared a 
global health emergency.    The plane will land at the 
Learmonth RAAF base in Western Australia just before 5pm AEST, where 
they will be met by military with military planes to fly them 
to Christmas Island for two weeks in quarantine.    Hotel 
management confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Serco has booked 
'several rooms' at the hotel, which is popular with airline staff, but 
denied claims foreigners were already being quarantined inside 
them.    'They have hired some rooms, but as far as we're 
aware, there is no quarantine situation taking place. In fact, we're 
certain the rooms are empty aside from the staff at the moment.   'They are here. There are some staff that have been here, but there isn't anybody here who is in quarantine.'    Those
 in isolation who show signs of coronavirus will be taken to hospital. 
Daily Mail Australia does not suggest the photographed people are being 
held in isolation    A man wears a mask outside the 
Sydney hotel on Monday after reports that the hotel was being used to 
quarantine victims of the coronavirus. Daily Mail Australia does 
not suggest the photographed people are being held in isolation   The
 establishment of the hotel isolation unit is part of a wider plan by 
Australian authorities to stop the spread of the infection, including 
the introduction of a two-week travel ban from China - the epicentre of 
the coronavirus outbreak.       On Monday, Sydney 
Ground Transport shuttle buses arrived constantly at the hotel, ferrying
 staff from Scoot Airlines back to Sydney Airport.   A driver for 
the company said he had an appointment to pick up airline staff at 
midday - and said all drivers had been told to wear face masks during 
the trips.      'We've been told to report anything we see,' he said.   About 12 uniformed hostesses and two men were ushered out of the building by hotel staff and straight on to the shuttle bus.   Their luggage was loaded into the back of the bus quickly.   Some of the airline staff also wore protective face masks for the trip.   One of the hostess's said they had been staying in the hotel but were about to board a return flight back to Singapore.   'We're actually just leaving,' she said.   'We've been here a while, but we're flying to Singapore today.'    When
 Daily Mail Australia asked whether they were being monitored for 
coronavirus inside the hotel, another air hostess interrupted to say 
they could not comment.    Within an hour, the same shuttle bus
 company arrived to do another trip, confirming there were more staff 
waiting in the building.    A flight attendant from Virgin 
Australia later told Daily Mail Australia said it was 'quite scary' to 
think quarantine was taking place at the hotel.    'I hope not.
 I'm just here because the normal hotel I stay in before a flight was 
full. That's quite a scary thought though so I hope there is nobody with
 it [coronavirus] in there,' he said.   Hotel guests who were not 
affiliated with the supposed quarantine quickly sprinted from the 
confines of the building to waiting cars wearing full face masks.   One woman said she was doing it for her safety, not because she had been exposed to the virus.

aclappinga and producing a agunshot-like sounda underwater for the first
 time.   The video was part of an international study led by Monash University in  Australia , and was published in the journal  Marine Mammal Science  on Sunday.   Clapping is believed to be used by male  grey seals  as a show of strength to warn competitors to stay away and attract potential mates.   Sharing the full story, not just the headlines   The sound created by the clap is described as a aloud 
high-frequency noisea that cuts through any background noise in order to
 send a aclear signala to nearby seals.   It was previously thought to be a vocal sound, but the new 
footage captured by Dr Ben Burville around Farne Islands, off the 
coast of Northumberland, clearly shows a male grey seal clapping its 
flippers to produce it.

    Mr Burville, a researcher at  Newcastle University ,  said :
 aI was diving off the Farne Islands when I first saw a large male clap 
underwater. The effect of the clap was instant and the rival males 
rapidly dispersed.   aThe clap was incredibly loud and at first I found it hard to 
believe what I had seen. How could a seal make such a loud clap 
underwater with no air to compress between its flippers?   aIave heard the distinctive shotgun-like aCrack!a many times over
 the years and I felt sure this clapping behaviour was the source, but 
filming the seals in action has eluded me for 17 years.   aThen one day I had heard a couple of slaps in the distance, I just hit the record button and eureka! I got it!,a he added.   Lead author Dr David Hocking of Monash University said: aThe 
discovery of aclapping sealsa might not seem that surprising, after all,
 theyare famous for clapping in zoos and aquaria.   aBut where zoo animals are often trained to clap for our 
entertainment a these grey seals are doing it in the wild of their own 
accord.   aClapping appears to be an important social behaviour for grey 
seals, so anything that disturbed it could impact breeding success and 
survival for this species.a   He added that noise pollution created by humans has been known to ainterferea with other forms of communications between  marine mammals , including whale song.   aBut if we do not know a behaviour exists, we cannot easily act to protect it,a he said.  "

Ben Burville, a marine biologist at Newcastle University in the UK,  filmed a seal clapping  its flippers together underwater near the Farne Islands, a group of islands off the northeast coast of England.    The seal's clapping produced a distinctive ""crack"" sound.   Burville spent 17 years attempting to capture the behavior on film before finally succeeding in October 2017.   Scientists
 believe bull seals make the noise underwater to deter competitors 
during the mating season, with the loud high-frequency sound sending a 
strong message to other males in the vicinity.    The sound was previously thought to be made vocally, but the new video footage   shows a gray seal clapping its flippers to create the noise.    Burville
 said in a statement that diving with seals was his passion and that he 
believes he has spent ""more time underwater with grey seals than anyone 
in the world.""     He added that this previously unseen behavior made him think about ""how much there still is to learn"" about the species.     The
 footage Burville captured is part of an international study led by 
Monash University in Australia, which is published on Monday in the 
journal Marine Mammal Science.    David
 Hocking, the lead author of the study and a research fellow at Monash, 
said noise pollution from humans interferes with whale song and other 
marine-mammal communication.     ""Clapping appears to be an 
important social behaviour for grey seals,"" he added, ""so anything that 
disturbed it could impact breeding success and survival for this 
species.""  "

 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences said in a recent statement: 'The

humans there may be an unknown intermediate.'    A number of dogs are also being kept in small cages looking malnourished while dead animals are left on top.   The
 shocking video has scared people into thinking coronavirus is 
spreading, as the first cases of the virus came from people visiting or 
working in a live animal market in Wuhan, China.   The market was 
selling seafood, wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines 
and camel meat but has since been closed down for investigation.   A
 Peking University scientific journal suggested the virus first 
infected snakes, which may then have transmitted it to people at the 
market in Wuhan.   It is claimed to be an 'extreme market', selling an array of animals including snakes, bats and possums   Throughout the video people at the markets are seen bashing a snake, while live cats are pulled out of cages by their necks   Peking

 trapped in coronavirus-plagued Wuhan have filmed themselves 
rollerblading through the ghost town before being evacuated to  Christmas  Island.   Rob Kellett, a professional rollerblader from  Brisbane ,
 and his friend Josh Nielsen took to the streets of the epicentre 
of the deadly virus, a normally-bustling city of 11million people, on 
January 29.   'This city has been put in lock-down and we've just 
spent the last week trapped in our apartment,' Mr Kellett told the 
camera, in a video shared to his YouTube channel.   'But we figured 
now would be a good time to make a little vlog, give people a little 
insight into what life is like here at the moment.'   Rob Kellett, a professional rollerblader from Brisbane, and his friend Josh Nielsen took to the streets of Wuhan on January 29   The pair donned face masks as they stepped outside of their apartment and into 'the virus-filled air'.   Mr
 Kellett filmed decorations which lined the street for the Chinese New 
Year but said the people of Wuhan were unable to celebrate the occasion 
due to the outbreak of the virus.    The two friends were able to leisurely skate along busy highways throughout the city as cars were nowhere to be seen.    They
 ventured through empty open public spaces which would normally be 
filled to the brim with residents going about their day-to-day 
activities.    'It's not great [what's happening in Wuhan] but we're trying to make the best out of a bad situation,' Mr Kellett said.   'I
 know I'll probably get heaps of comments from people telling us that 
we're stupid but it's whatever. We're trying to have fun and we're just 
trying to pass the time.   Mr Kellett said the video was to give people an 'insight' into the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus   The two friends were able to leisurely skate along busy highways throughout the city as cars were nowhere to be seen   'There is literally no one around. So we've hardly been in contact with people all day, no real chance of catching anything.   'As you can see, not a soul in sight.'      Mr
 Kellett, who said it was 'pretty scary' to be stuck in Wuhan, moved 
into the city towards the end of 2019 to be closer to his 
girlfriend.    The pair are understood to be among the first Australian citizens evacuated from Wuhan to Christmas Island.    Mr Kellet,
 whose girlfriend remains in Wuhan, filmed himself on the plane saying: 
'Who knows what the right choice was but it's the safer one.'   Mr Nielsen shared messages to his father on social media.   Pictured: The view from Mr Kellett's apartment showed bare roads   Mr
 Kellett, who said it was 'pretty scary' to be stuck in Wuhan, moved 
into the city towards the end of 2019 to be closer to his girlfriend   'Hey dad just thought I'd give you the latest update,' he said.   'There's a flight leaving here in five hours and I'm at the airport,' to which his father responded: 'Great news Josh.'   A
 team of specialist doctors and nurses are closely monitoring the 243 
Australian evacuees, who were flown out of Wuhan in Hubei province on 
Monday.   They endured about 24 hours in transit, including a stop 
at Western Australia's RAAF Base Learmonth, near Exmouth, before being 
taken on smaller aircraft to the island.   The National Critical 
Care and Trauma Response Centre is overseeing their care, and says 
medics on the island have reported all of the evacuees are well.   'They
 haven't shown signs of the virus, and all going well, God willing, they
 won't be showing signs of it and will in 14 days repatriate back home 
to their nation, Australia,' the centre's executive director Len Notaras
 told ABC radio on Tuesday.     The first 
Australian citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan have landed
 on Christmas Island (pictured arriving in WA before transferring to a 
charter flight for last leg)   The pair are understood to be among the first Australian citizens evacuated from Wuhan to Christmas Island    Meanwhile, more than 100 other Australians are expected to join an Air New Zealand charter flight from Wuhan to Auckland.   New
 Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says the flight has 
departed and will stop in Hong Kong before continuing on to Wuhan.   It said Chinese authorities had cleared the flight to land late on Tuesday, Wuhan time, which is early morning in New Zealand.   The flight is expected to be back in Auckland late on Wednesday afternoon, New Zealand time.   The
 number and nationalities of passengers is yet to be confirmed, but they
 will include New Zealanders and possibly Pacific Islanders too.    There have been 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, and more than 17,000 cases and 360 deaths globally.   Foreign travellers who have left or passed through China will be denied entry to Australia to limit the spread of the virus.

 Chinese student who snuck into Australia has bragged about how he 
flouted the coronavirus travel ban, putting thousands in danger of 
contracting the deadly disease.   He admitted to lying to  immigration  officials by claiming he arrived from Hong Kong, when he in fact flew to Sydney from mainland  China .   The
 government brought in emergency measures over the weekend which bar any
 passenger who has left or passed through mainland China from entering 
Australia.    There are already 12 people in Australia with 
coronavirus, which has killed 362 worldwide and threatens to become a 
global pandemic.    Daily Mail Australia alerted the Department
 of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force to the breach, but did 
they did not respond to requests for comment.    The student claimed he flew into Brisbane airport (pictured, other passengers arriving at the coastal airport before the ban)   The
 student, whose name was given as Xiao K, started his journey in China, 
changing planes in Hong Kong before arriving in Brisbane.    Revealing
 he lied on his yellow incoming passenger card, he bragged that he 
quickly crossed out 'China' as his place of departure and instead wrote 
'Hong Kong'.    Worryingly, he boasted that customs officials didn't even check his luggage.   'Fortunately, they were focusing on people.    'In the end, they didn't even check my suitcase.'   The
 student admitted he had no idea about the China ban, but when he found 
out about it decided to flout the rules and enter Australia illegally 
(pictured, the first of series of texts)   In an 
incriminating message (pictured) the student says he changed his arrival
 card to say 'Hong Kong' instead of 'China' as his original place of 
departure   Passengers arriving in Australia are required under Australian law to identify themselves and provide certain information.   When you arrive in Australia from a foreign country, you are given a passenger card to fill in.   One of the boxes asks for the name of the 'country in which you boarded the flight'.   But this Chinese student wrote 'Hong Kong' in this section, despite starting his journey in China.   With this, he claims authorities did not question him and simply waved him through.   If he had written 'China' in the box, he would have been stopped and questioned.     The student claimed he didn't know about the ban when he first boarded a plane in an unknown Chinese airport.   He
 claimed to have thought he would have to go into isolation for 14 days 
when on Australia soil, but was soon informed about the travel ban by a 
friend.   Before going through immigration in Australian, he then exploited an airport loophole to change his arrival card.   'When
 I was clearing immigration a customs officer checked my arrival card,' 
he explained in a series of damning texts seen by Daily Mail 
Australia.    'Because Iad heard the news about the China entry after landing Iad changed mine to say Hong Kong.   'They looked at me and told me to go through a different channel with my luggage.   'They just let me go through.'   He was then asked if he meant the immigration declaration card.   The
 student admitted he was waved through immigration in a series of 
shocking text messages, which have been translated by Daily Mail 
Australia   China has gone into lockdown after the virus claimed more than 400 lives (pictured, students in Beijing)    Australia is one of many countries organising evacuation flights home (pictured, Singaporeans boarding a charter flight)   The
 travel ban measures were announced on the same day Qantas (airline 
staff pictured on Friday)  revealed plans to suspend its direct 
flights to mainland China   He replied: 'Yes. The yellow one. I crossed off ""China"" and changed it to ""Hong Kong"".'   Asked
 how he felt after flagrantly disregarding the rules, which are intended
 to keep Australians safe, he replied: 'Really lucky!'   The Department of Foreign Affairs has raised its travel advice for China to the highest level of 'do not travel'.    From February 1, foreign nationals who have left mainland China are not allowed entry into Australia.   Visitors
 flying in from mainland China are being denied entry to Australia. 
Pictured are passengers at Brisbane Airport on Friday, just hours before
 the ban came into place   Three more cases of coronavirus (pictured) confirmed on Saturday took Australia's tally to 12   The student claims he left China on February 1, just hours after the ban came into place, and arrived into Brisbane at 11.45pm.   People arriving
 from mainland China, not just the Hubei province, are required to 
self-isolate for 14 days after they leave the country.   But for 
this student, it was only a matter of hours - potentially leaving the 
public at serious risk of harm if he were to be infected.     Permanent
 residents and their immediate family are still able to enter Australia,
 as well as airline crews who have been using appropriate personal 
protective equipment.   The beefed up measures came on the same day 
three more coronavirus cases - one in Melbourne and two in South 
Australia - were confirmed, taking the national tally to 12.   Qantas
 also announced on Saturday that it was suspending its two direct 
services to mainland China from February 9 until March 28.    'Our first responsibility is to Australians,' Mr Morrison told reporters on Saturday afternoon.   'As
 of Saturday, all travellers arriving out of mainland China are being 
asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they depart 
the country.   'In addition to that, there'll be advanced screening 
and reception arrangements put into place at the major airports to 
facilitate identifying and providing this information and ensuring the 
appropriate precautions are being put in place,' Mr Morrison said.   A

off these flights as well as those who are with those coming from those 
flights.   'There'll also be thermometers which are provided to 
those airports and we're working with those airport authorities now to 
ensure we can put those arrangements in place.'    The announcement came just hours after two more victims of the virus were identified in South Australia.   A Chinese couple in their 60s from the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, were visiting family in the state.   SA

 of Australians have been rescued from the coronavirus epicentre of 
Wuhan, as the Chinese city of 11 million people went into 
lockdown.    But the emergency  Qantas  flight puzzled aviation specialists, who were confused by the unusually long route the plane took to rescue stranded civilians.   There
 is a direct route that would be the quickest way to fly citizens back 
from Wuhan, going directly south and continuing until the plane is over 
Australia.   Instead, the crew of four pilots and 14 cabin crew - 
who all volunteered for the mission - decided to remain almost entirely 
in international air space.   The Qantas flight took an 
unusual flight from Wuhan to Western Australia (pictured) with experts 
saying it did so to avoid flying in international airspace   This
 allowed the crew to avoid wasting precious time by seeking Landing and 
Overflight permits, which experts said can be 'time consuming'.    As
 the flight was an emergency charter and not scheduled, it would have to
 have requested overfly approval to fly in a country's airspace.   The
 unusual route it took allowed it to avoid entering the jurisdiction of 
the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and Indonesia.   The Qantas flight (pictured) landed in Western Australian at an RAAF base near Exmouth on Monday afternoon   Carrying
 241 Australian citizens, who paid $1,000 each to be evacuated, the 
Qantas flight left Wuhan and arrived in Western Australia on Monday 
afternoon.   It landed at the RAAF Learmonth base, near Exmouth, 
where the passengers were transferred onto a series of smaller planes 
bound for Christmas Island.    Mr Morrison said all passengers 
had now been transferred into a two-week-long quarantine on Christmas 
Island, other than a pregnant woman and her partner who will remain in 
isolation in Perth.   Two Australians (pictured) wore face masks as they spoke about their rescue flight out of Wuhan    Footage
 emerged showing the Australian citizens aboard the Qantas rescue flight
 (pictured) which was staffed by four pilots and 14 cabin crew, all of 
whom volunteered for the mission   Of the passengers that returned safely to Australia, five were under two years old while 89 were younger than 16.   'Thank
 you to everyone involved in what has been a complex and very 
challenging operation, from our medical staff, Qantas ground and aircrew
 to Australian diplomats and other officials,a Mr Morrison wrote on 
Instagram.   'I particularly want to thank the Chinese Government for their co-operative approach.'      But
 some worried families decided not to make the trip, fearing the medical
 facilities on the isolated island would not be up to scratch.   The
 citizens were met by army and medics (pictured) in Western Australia 
before being taken to buses ahead of a 14-day quarantine   It 
is the first of what is likely to be two flights giving Australians the 
change to escape Wuhan, where the coronavirus first broke out in a local
 food market.    Aviation expert Neil Hansford told  news.com.au :

 rollerblader Rob Kellet, whose girlfriend remains in Wuhan, filmed 
himself on the plane saying: 'Who knows what the right choice was but

Three more cases of coronavirus (pictured) confirmed on Saturday took Australia's tally to 12   'Hey dad just thought I'd give you the latest update,' he said.   'There's a flight leaving here in five hours and I'm at the airport,' to which his father responded: 'Great news Josh.'   WA
 Health Minister Roger Cook said it would likely take considerable time 
for the passengers to be assessed once they landed at Learmonth.   'My
 understanding is the federal government is anticipating that scenario 
and they have the appropriate accommodation for those patients on the 
ground,' he told reporters in Perth.   WA authorities have made contingency plans to immediately transport any unwell passengers to hospitals in Perth if needed.   Of the 243 passengers, five are under two years old while 89 are younger than 16.   Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the plan was for passengers to be isolated in small family groups on Christmas Island.   'There won't be a full mingling,' he said in Canberra.   As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 12 cases of coronavirus in Australia, and more than 20,000 people infected worldwide.   The virus has killed 426 people in China, officials confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.   It
 comes after the country opened a new hospital built in 10 days, infused
 cash into tumbling financial markets and further restricted people's 
movement in hopes of containing the rapidly spreading virus and its 
escalating impact.   Despite this, the death toll rose by a daily record of 65 from Monday to Tuesday, the National Health Commission confirmed.   There
 are at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions, including the
 United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.   Of the 20,626 afflicted with the virus, 14 per cent are in a critical condition - though 653 have now recovered.

several scheduled ports due to the coronavirus threat.   Grandparents
 David Holst and his wife Judy are on Holland America's MS Westerdam, 
which entered Hong Kong on Saturday resulting in a planned stopover in 
Manila being cancelled when authorities denied the boat entry.   Mr 
Holst posted on Sunday on his Facebook page, 'It was greed and stupidity
 when Holland America sent our ship into Hong Kong yesterday given HK is
 on red alert, the highest level you can have around the virus and other
 cruise lines were cancelling HK stops as HK is the gateway to China'.   Ray White Dulwich has temporarily closed its doors and is to re-open on February 6    He
 said the crew 'did not even bother to offer face masks to passengers 
going ashore' so they disembarked using their own and they 'did not see 
any temperature screening for those 700-800 joining the cruise'.   He
 described sanitation prevention on the liner as 'ordinary' and said 
they were not amused as it was totally avoidable if Holland America had 
acted 'more responsibly'.   Mr Holst said planned stops at Hualien 
in Taiwan on Tuesday had now also been cancelled, but the liner was 
heading to Kaohsiung further south on Wednesday.   He said there 
were 'plenty of Aussies' on board, including others from Adelaide and 
criticised the cruise company for only really caring 'about dollars'.   Hong Kong has recorded 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus.    Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ray White for comment.     Two

 Fishermen's Cooperative (GFC) were expecting the Chinese New Year 
period to be their busiest time with around 50 to 60 tonnes of lobster 
being handled each day.    But CEO Matt Rutter said they have 
taken a massive blow in the wake of the market closure and fear it will 
be some time before it reopens.   Lobsters that once sold for $48 are now selling for $15 less.   'We
 are estimating that we have a month's worth of western rock lobster 
that we will continue to sell out of WA,' Mr Rutter told the  ABC .   He
 said there was a few hundred tonnes that had been shipped before the 
market shut down - with the western rock lobster making up a large 
proportion.     Mr Rutter said that despite the low prices for consumers, staff and fishermen within the industry were at a loss.   Hundreds of tonnes of lobster are now stranded in seawater holding tanks, forcing industries to sell them at reduced prices   'Because
 we don't have product flowing through the door, we don't have trucks 
driving or people at the depots receiving a| a lot of the staff that

'It's not just the fishers who are hurting, but everyone who relies on the industry for income.'    GFC can hold 220 tonnes of lobster in refrigerated seawater storage tanks that keep them from four to six weeks.

   As an associate professor at an Australian 
university who was educated at unranked universities in India, I find it
 disturbing that some universities are now using international 
university rankings to help assess graduate students for admission. In 
my view, this risks promoting and institutionalizing discrimination, and
 hence undermines global efforts to increase diversity in academia.   When
 I applied in 1998 to do a PhD at the University of Zurich, Switzerland,
 the university requested my degree-course syllabuses from India. My 
opportunities were not scuttled by the ranking of those universities. So
 I was shocked when one of my students showed me the applications 
section for masteras programmes at several premier institutions . These 
required applicants to give the ranking of the university where they 
studied as an undergraduate, for use as an assessment parameter.   Such
 aobjectivea metrics could be viewed as a way to reduce the selection 
workload and avoid unconscious biases. But individuals should not be 
assessed through a group-based metric that reinforces stereotypes. And, 
given that university rankings are correlated with per capita gross 
domestic product ( E. F. Tuesta  et al. J. Data Inf. Sci.   4 , 56a78; 2019 ), organizations also risk making the serious mistake of equating an applicantas ability with regional and economic differences.    Nature    578 , 37 (2020)    doi: 10.1038/d41586-020-00303-1  "

 Australia a Early on the morning of Dec. 27, Phoebe Meagher, a wildlife
 conservation officer at Taronga Zoo, set off on a rescue mission with 
colleagues from the zoo and academics from the University of New South 
Wales. Several platypuses were trapped in quickly shrinking bodies of 
water in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in the Australian Capital Territory,
 and wildfires were fast approaching. There was a window of a few days 
before the park would be entirely closed off to the public, and two 
weeks until the bodies of water would be completely dry.   A 
five-hour drive brought the team to what was once a lake. Now, it was 
mostly deep, sucking mud. The air was hot and smoky. aInitially we 
thought we werenat going to be trapping until the evening,a Dr. Meagher 
said. Platypuses are nocturnal, usually waking up around sunset. But 
these platypuses were already active, which, while concerning, meant the
 team could see where they were.   aThere was hardly any water 
there,a Dr. Meagher said. aSo they couldnat duck down and hide and be 
cryptic like they usually are.a   Platypuses are difficult to catch;
 they are fast, slippery swimmers and desperately shy. The males also 
have a sharp, venomous spur behind one of their hind feet. The venom is 
not lethal to humans, but there is no antidote, and the pain can last 
months.   The scientists dragged a net through
 the remaining water in four areas of the reserve. With the help of a 
small aluminum boat and a pool scooper, they caught two males and five 
females. The animals were placed into cotton pillowcases, then given 
health checks a while suspended upside down by their tails a and driven 
to the zoo in Sydney, where they will probably remain for months, until 
enough rain has fallen to replenish Tidbinbillaas supplies.   One of
 the biggest issues facing the zoo was that other reserves were asking 
them to rescue their platypuses, too, but Taronga didnat yet have the 
space. aI donat think drought and bushfires are going away,a Dr. Meagher
 said. aWe have to prepare for these types of climatic disasters moving 
forward more and more.a She was spending her days asking, aHow do we 
have the resources to be able to say, aAll right, letas go rescue 50 
platypusa?a   The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the platypus as near-threatened. In January,  a study 
 by scientists from the University of New South Wales and the University
 of Melbourne estimated that climate change could lead the number of 
platypuses to decline by as much as 73 percent in the next 50 years. 
Last October, scientists from the University of New South Wales 
published  a study in Global Ecology and Conservation  showing that for the last decade there had been no records of platypuses in 41 percent of their previous range.   December was Australiaas  hottest and driest December on record ; 2019 was its  hottest and driest year on record ;
 and the country has been experiencing a severe drought for three years,
 a key factor in why the ongoing wildfires have been so severe. 
Platypuses are found mainly along the east coast of Australia, which has
 been the area worst impacted by the fires. The eastern states are also 
home to  80 percent of Australiaas human population .   In
 January, Aussie Ark, an animal welfare organization, discovered two 
dead platypuses in dried up waterways. The group relocated four others 
and took five more into their care. Platypuses are also threatened by 
pollution, land clearing and predation from invasive species, including 
foxes and feral dogs and cats a especially when platypuses choose to 
travel over land to seek out new bodies of water. (They can retract the 
webbing on their feet to walk with their claws.) In the 19th century, 
tens of thousands of platypuses were killed for their thick pelts, which
 were turned into slippers or rugs.   Gilad Bino, a researcher at 
the University of New South Wales and the lead author on the January 
platypus study, said that old newspapers and studies described seeing aa
 dozen platypus in a pool, and using words that we would never use now, 
like aplatypus migrationa.a Today there are nothing like those numbers. 
Australia has the  worst mammal extinction rates  in the world.   In 2018, scientists at Monash University estimated that some platypuses could be ingesting  half a human dose of antidepressants  from aquatic insects in streams near Melbourne, which have been shown to have high levels of these and other drugs.   An
 Aboriginal dreamtime story about the platypus (one indigenous name for 
the animal is Dharragarra) explains its origin as the product of a 
courtship between a water rat and a duck. Platypuses have fur, bills, 
webbed feet and a beaver-like tail, and they lay eggs. The only other 
egg-laying mammal is the echidna, also endemic to Australia. Young 
platypuses live with their mothers for up to four months, suckling on 
milk released through pores on the motheras chest. They evolved 120 
million years ago and offer insight into the link between mammals and 
reptiles.   Platypuses may be of value for human medicine. Their milk contains a unique antibacterial protein that could lead to  new, superbug-resistant antibiotics , according to scientists at Deakin University in Australia. Their venom might help  fight Type 2 diabetes ;
 in 2016, scientists at Flinders University and the University of 
Adelaide discovered that platypus venom contained a long-lasting hormone
 that promotes the release of insulin.   Robert Dockerill, a senior 
keeper at Taronga Zoo, describes platypuses as aDr. Frankensteinas first
 attempt.a He likes to joke that platypuses and echidnas are the only 
animals that can make custard, because they produce both eggs and milk. 
Forty years ago, he said, he watched platypuses swimming at his 
great-uncleas farm in Armidale, on the North Coast of New South Wales. 
The town has been hit particularly hard by the drought. Then, in 
January, rain washed soil and ash from the bushfires into the Macleay 
River,  causing thousands of fish to die .   As
 he spoke, Mr. Dockerill stood in front of a tank at Taronga Zoo that 
held one of the rescued platypuses, a male. aHeas pretty much done 
nothing but eat since he got here,a he said. He noted that one way to 
tell the health of a platypus was to use the atail volume index.a 
Platypuses store fat in their tails; the more a tail can bend, the less 
fat it holds. When the male had come in, he had a T.V.I. of four, five 
being the worst. He was now almost a one.   The room housing the 
platypuses was dark, so that they would be active, thinking it was 
nighttime. Their tanks, decorated with fresh eucalyptus branches and 
fern fronds, glowed faintly. The rescued platypus dove through the 
leaves, wriggling its head as it searched the small pebbles in the tank 
floor for food. Platypuses use their bills to detect the electric fields
 emitted by their prey, which consist mostly of invertebrates. They are 
particularly fond of ayabbies,a small blue freshwater crayfish.   Yet
 another threat faced by platypuses are yabby traps, also known as Opera
 House traps because of their shape. Platypuses need to surface in order
 to breathe, but the traps keep them underwater, and they drown. Opera 
House traps are illegal in Victoria, parts of New South Wales and the 
Australian Capital Territory.   As
 the rescued male dived, a steady stream of bubbles emerged from his 
body. The effect, actually caused by air trapped in their fur, gave rise
 to an early misconception about platypuses, that they abreathed through
 their butts,a Mr. Dockerill said.   The male climbed onto a 
platform and changed positions like a swimsuit model posing for a 
photograph a at one point pressing his belly against the glass. In a 
nearby tank, Annie the platypus, a longtime Taronga resident, rolled 
onto her back, scratching herself with a webbed foot. Mr. Dockerill 
raised Annie by hand after she was brought into the zoo with injuries 
inflicted by a dog.   aI donat care what the zoo says, sheas mine,a 
he said, smiling. Often, he gives her a scratch in the mornings, but 
that day he could not visit any of the zooas platypuses; he had already 
worked with the wild ones, which were under quarantine, which meant he 
was too.   Through a private door leading away from
 the public exhibit, and up narrow metal stairs were two more tanks a 
and the opening above the rescued maleas tank, into which Mr. Dockerill 
scattered live beetle larvae and fly pupae. The other tanks each held a 
rescued female and several bright blue yabbies, which appeared to wait 
nervously on branches of eucalyptus floating in the water. Suddenly, one
 of the females caught a yabby and proceeded to roll and shake it to 
death, like a tiny, furry crocodile.   Richard 
Kingsford, an aquatic ecologist at the University of New South Wales and
 another author of the recent study documenting the decline in platypus 
numbers, also grew up watching platypuses in the river, in his case the 
Abercrombie River, west of Sydney.   He described their courtship 
ritual. aThey seem to do this weird tumble turning, where they sort of 
go around in circles within the water, chasing each other,a he said. 
During the ritual, the male and female nip at each otheras tails.   Australia
 is the worldas driest inhabited continent. Man-made dams, and the 
diversion of water to irrigated agriculture, have had a significant 
impact on biodiversity, Dr. Kingsford said. Last week, fires flared up 
again in the Australian Capital Territory, moving closer to Tidbinbilla.
 Rangers at the reserve began catching and relocating other species, 
including brush-tailed rock wallabies, Northern Corroboree frogs and 
bettongs (also known as rat-kangaroos), the  Canberra Times reported . On Jan. 31 the government declared a state of emergency in the territory.   Dr.
 Bino, the lead author on the paper published in January, said that the 
current trajectory a aif we continue to clear land and not improve the 
habitat, and if youare assuming that demand for fresh water is going to 
increase over time, and then you add climate changea a will only further
 the disappearance of the platypus. As local populations fragment and 
grow ever smaller, he said, ait becomes quite easy for us to drive a 
species to extinction.a  "

case they needed a doctor in the middle of the night.    But others said the state of the facility were 'acceptable' and 'very simple but clean'.   Sydney resident Gloria Zeng said there was a large courtyard with grass for kids to run around on.    She also said staff painted a welcome sign to greet the evacuees with when they arrived in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

 concerned about contracting the coronavirus are being asked to fork out
 hundreds of dollars for face masks as fears about contracting the virus
 continue to rise.    A chemist in Sydney's Top Ryde, which has
 a large Chinese and Asian population, is allegedly selling a box of 50 
face masks this week to $400 a pack - more than four times the usual 
price.   They aren't the only ones cashing in on the outbreak as 
bystanders took a picture of a man selling individual face masks for 
$10, or 12 masks for $100.   The masks are sold at chemists for about $5 each or they can be bought in bulk online for about $110 for 50.   A
 chemist in Sydney's Top Ryde had jacked up the price of a box of 50 
face masks this week to $400 a pack - more than four times the usual

 high prices come as many chemists and pharmacies around the country 
have been left with bare shelves amid fears of contracting coronavirus.   Images
 from Chemist Warehouse's store in Chatswood, which also has a large 
Chinese population, have shown several rows of empty shelves in recent 
weeks.   A representative from Chemist Warehouse Chatswood told 
Daily Mail Australia they had no face masks and hand sanitiser in store 
on Thursday last week, and they didn't know when more stock would become
 available.   'Masks have been in really high demand,' the representative said.    'Since the beginning of January, the masks have been in short supply.'   Face
 mask sales initially increased amid poor air quality and during the 
smokey conditions through Australia's terrible bushfire season, causing 
wholesalers to run out of supplies.   Chatswood Chemist Warehouse 
received their last delivery of face masks in the beginning of January 
and have since run out, and have been trying to order more every day to 
keep up with customers demand.   A sign posted in a Chemist Warehouse store in Brisbane, where no face masks were available   Signs
 have been put up in chemists around the country including Chemist 
Warehouse in Chatswood to notify customers that there are no supplies of
 face masks and hand sanitisers   The representative said 
'every five minutes' customers are asking when they will get more stock,
 and that their suppliers had began to run out of product.   Chemist Warehouse, in Chatswood, stock ten different brands of hand sanitiser, and all of them are vacant from their shelves.   Their
 last delivery of hand sanitisers lasted less than one day, with the 
entire shipment of stock being sold out in one morning.   In addition, Bunnings hardware stores were either sold out of P2 and N95 masks or quickly running out of stock.    A sign posted outside of Chemist Warehouse's store in Chatswood reading 'no masks available, out of stock'   There
 are already 13 people in Australia who have been diagnosed with 
coronavirus, which has killed 362 worldwide and threatens to become a 
global pandemic.    The highly-contagious virus has infected more than 17,000 people worldwide.   It has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO).   Australia
 citizens trapped in Wuhan have now been evacuated and have landed on 
Christmas Island, where they will enter a quarantine for 14 
days.     A man wearing a face mask cycles past the

Prime Minister  Scott Morrison  has confirmed a group of 35 Australians left Wuhan on Wednesday morning on an Air New Zealand flight.   The
 aircraft also evacuated up to 100 Kiwis and a number of Pacific 
islanders to Auckland, where the Australians will then be transferred to
  Christmas  Island.    The
 prime minister warned Australians still in Wuhan - the epicentre of the
 outbreak - that a second assisted evacuation flight home could possibly
 be the last.   'What I want to tell people is that they can't count on a further flight beyond that,' he told Nine Network.    Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed a group of 35 Australians left 
Wuhan on Wednesday morning on an Air New Zealand flight (file picture)   The details of the second evacuation flight are still to be negotiated with Chinese authorities.   Australia
 now has 13 confirmed cases of the deadly coronavirus after an 
eight-year-old boy was isolated in a Queensland hospital.     The
 child, from Wuhan - the epicentre of the virus outbreak - was a member 
of a tour group travelling in Australia in late January.   Two other
 people from that group, a man, 44, and a woman, 42, also had the virus 
and Queensland health authorities had been scrambling to contact other 
people on their flights in case the infection had spread.   'The 
child remains in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital and is 
currently stable,' the state's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeanette Young 
said.   The case of the boy takes the number of confirmed cases in 
Queensland to three, adding to the four cases in each of NSW and 
Victoria and two in South Australia. The nation infection rate now 
stands at 13 people.   The Australian people travelling to Auckland 
will then be taken to Christmas Island, off the north-west coast of 
Western Australia, where they will join about 241 citizens and permanent
 residents who arrived on Monday and Tuesday.      The Air NZ aircraft was flying over the Phillippines around 7.30am AEDT.   Medical staff are seen wearing protective clothing outside a hospital in Wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak   So
 far, there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus infection among 
the men, women and children already on Christmas Island, where they are 
being held for up to two weeks.   A team of specialist doctors and nurses is closely monitoring the evacuees, who were flown out of Wuhan on a Qantas flight.   Up
 to 600 Australians initially registered for the evacuation flights home
 but some have decided to remain in Wuhan. It is not clear how many will
 join the next flight.   Globally, 426 people - mostly Chinese 
citizens - have died from the virus, including one death in the 
Philippines. The number of confirmed cases stands at 20,630.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

 in the usually bustling area of Eastwood in the city's north-west are 
struggling as people avoid the suburb partly due to hysteria on social

China.   The airline provided passengers with a bright yellow plastic 'clinical waste' bags on their seats.   After
 landing on Christmas Island the evacuees - who wore face masks and 
included men, women and children - were met by army and medics and taken
 to buses   Inside the emergency kit was sanitiser, face masks and hand wipes.   Passengers underwent health checks before boarding the flight and were set to wear surgical masks.   There
 was a limited food and beverage service to minimise interaction between
 crew and passengers and the plane will now undergo a three-day cleaning
 process.   The crew had masks, gloves, and sanitisers and were placed on the upper deck of the aircraft.   The plane has medical-grade filters that remove particles in the air, including viruses.   Foreign
 Minister Marise Payne said the government would 'consider what might be
 necessary' when asked if a second flight would be organised from Wuhan.   There have been 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, and more than 17,000 cases and 360 deaths globally.

 wore the face mask for her shift at UGG Australian Collection, near 
Sydney Opera House, on January 23.     The 24-year-old, 
who is on a working holiday visa, claims she was asked to remove the 
face mask or 'go home' by her manager and boss.   But the store boss
 claims Tiffany has not lost her job over the incident and other staff 
members have been allowed to wear masks.    Pictured: Tiffany

 Tiffany said there wasn't a lot of information about the virus at the 
time of the incident but she knew it was deemed similar to SARS.   'Having
 the lesson from SARS outbreak in my hometown, wearing a mask is 
the best way to protect myself from getting the disease,' she told 
Daily Mail Australia.   'Given the rising confirmed cases [of coronavirus] around the world, I decided to wear a mask as a personal protection.   'My
 job involves numerous face-to face contact with Chinese tourists and I 
have no idea where in China where they're from.'     Tiffany said her manager told her to remove the mask.    When she asked if she could wear it while serving tourist groups from China, Tiffany claims she was again told no.   'I don't think this [wearing a mask] affects my personal working ability,' Tiffany said.   'At the same time, I had a mild cough so I didn't want to spread that.'   the
 24-year-old claims she also asked customers if they would have a 
problem with her wearing a face mask and they responded it would be 
'fine'.     Tiffany said her manager then called her 
superior, who she claims also said 'no' to her wearing the protective 
measure.     Pictured: The UGG Australian

to work on January 23, amid heightened anxiety about the spread of

 the day later, Tiffany said she was removed from the store's WhatsApp 
group, where employees receive their rosters and work-related 
updates.    'This is undoubtedly an act to show that I was fired,' she said.      She said she emailed her boss a few times to request a back payment and letter of termination but the emails bounced back.   Tiffany
 said wearing a face mask is 'personal protection' against infection and
 shouldn't impact her ability to work. Pictured: Travellers wear face

 response to his message's, Tiffany said: 'I never said that I 
wasn't coming back. Now he's just making false accusations.'    'He
 asked me if I'm going back to work but you just fired me and you won't 
let me wear a mask. I just think he wants to get the thing 
resolved.'    Tiffany said it is a 'good thing' if the store are now letting employees wear face masks.    'To
 be honest, wearing a mask is a personal protection thing. As long as it
 doesn't affect my working ability, it doesn't matter. It's about 
safety,' she said.    Tiffany's boss claims she was not told to take off her mask and was not fired. The Circular Quay store is pictured   Tiffany
 said she is seeking legal advice over the incident and Fair Work have 
advised it's a difficult case due to its 'he said, she said' 
nature.    The store's boss claims Tiffany was not told to take off her mask and was not fired.   'We
 told her she could take some time off [during the virus] and her job 
would still be here but she said ''no'',' he told Daily Mail 
Australia.    'We have staff members wearing the masks today [Wednesday], I'm not going to tell one employee not wear a mask.'

The deadly disease reached Australia last month and has since infected 13 people in the country.    Doctors
 testing patients for the virus say they have witnessed racism against 
Australians of Asian heritage because it originated in Wuhan,  China  where it has killed around 500 people.   They
 say people have come to hospital with concerns they will catch the 
virus after having a Chinese takeaway or sitting next to an Asian person
 on the bus.   Gold Coast surgeon Dr Rhea Liang posted a tweet last week saying she was racially abused by a patient.   She wrote: 'Today a patient made jokes about not shaking my hand because of coronavirus. In front of my team.   'I have not left Australia. This is not sensible public health precautions.

gratified by the largely supportive response'.   Gold Coast surgeon Dr Rhea Liang posted a tweet (above) last week saying she was racially abused by a patient   Dr
 Simon Judkins, of the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, said 
he too has witnessed racism against Chinese Australians.   'We've 
seen people turn up saying they are worried they may have coronavirus 
because they sat on a bus next to someone of Asia appearance,' he told 
ABC program  The World Today .   'We've
 having reports of staff being asked by patients whether they've been 
home lately even though they were born and raised in Australia.'   Dr
 Lai Heng Foong, an emergency doctor in Sydney, said one mother feared 
her child may catch the disease simply because he goes to school with 
Asian children.   He told the program: 'The mother brought in her 
child who was about six. She said ""my child goes to school with a lot of
 Asian people I just want to check to make sure that he doesn't have 
coronavirus"".'   'He didn't even have any cough or fever, just happened to be [on his] first day back at school'.    Restaurants in South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Vietnam (pictured) have refused to accept Chinese customers   French Asians are using a hashtag 'I am not a virus' in an effort to counter racist abuse    It is not only doctors who have reported witnessing racism.    Sydney resident Angela Prendergast told  Guardian Australia 
 she saw a young Asian mother with a baby in a pram being abused on a 
train by a middle-aged white woman who told her to stand in the corner 
of the carriage.   She said: 'I heard her yelling ""You need to cough
 over there. You need to stop coughing. That's how viruses get 
spread"".'      Chin Tan, Race Commissioner at the 
Australian Human Rights Commission, said the Chinese community is 
'really suffering' from racism due to the coronavirus.    'The 
Chinese community is really suffering because of victimisation and 
conduct that seems to profile the Chinese community. It's not fair and 
it's not helpful,' he told The World Today.    Chinese citizens have faced a racist backlash across the world following the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus.   Restaurants in  South Korea ,  Japan , Hong Kong and Vietnam have refused to accept Chinese customers.   Indonesians marched near a hotel and called on Chinese guests there to leave.    Chinese and other Asians in Europe, the United States, Asia and the Pacific complained of racism.   French
 Asians have taken to social media to vent their anger, with the hashtag
 'JeNeSuisPasUnVirus' ('IAmNotAVirus') trending last week.    Passengers wear protective face masks as they arrive in Hong Kong after getting the train from Shenzhen     NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

 young girl has chosen to leave an exclusive boarding school after she 
was banned from her dormitory amid fears she may have coronavirus.   Chinese students at private schools across Australia were kept segregated from their classmates if they had visited  China  over the  Christmas  holidays. The extreme measures were to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.    However, the year 10 student from  South Korea 
 was forced to leave her dorm at Ravenswood School for Girls, on 
Sydney's north shore, even though she visited China in October - before 
the outbreak began.   Her dad, Peter Kim, was outraged that the school had forced his daughter to miss two weeks of school.    The

 was banned from her dormitory amid fears she may have coronavirus   'To
 take the measure of not only preventing her from joining class, but 
telling her to leave her dorm, seems like an extreme response,' he told 
the  Sydney Morning Herald .    'Despite
 (my) protest that she did not visit China (since the outbreak) and did 
not have contact with any visitors from China and no symptoms of any 
virus, the school maintained that they were erring on the safe side.'   His daughter has since changed to a different school where she was able to attend straight away.    Principal
 Anne Johnstone said their health and safety protocols had been 
established in response to the 'unprecedented, rapidly evolving' 
health crisis.    'Our actions were not personal but were 
driven by our responsibilities to (the student) and to our broader 
school community,' she said.    'We do not step back from 
taking the strongest and most cautious advice from WHO, as we have a 
duty to protect all students not just those who had been in areas 
covered by the warnings or marked red on the map.'   Fears of the virus spreading through schools are high after it was introduced to Australia last month from  China , where it was first detected in Wuhan.    A

 Australians are among the 10 to have tested positive for coronavirus on
 a cruise liner off the Japanese port of Yokohama.    Screening
 began on Tuesday for some 3,700 passengers and crew - 200 of whom are 
Australian - aboard the anchored vessel after a Hong Kong passenger who 
sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for the Wuhan 
coronavirus.   The 10 infected people included two Australian 
guests, three Japanese guests, three guests from Hong Kong, and one
 guest from the United States, in addition to one Filipino crew member, a
 spokesman for Princess Cruises confirmed to Daily Mail Australia.   They
 will be transported to a medical facility while the remaining thousands
 will be quarantined on board the Carnival Corp ship for 14 days, Japan 
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.   'I want to take sufficient 
care of the health of passengers and crew and make every effort to 
prevent the spread of the virus,' Kato said at a media briefing.   Everyone
 on board the Diamond Princess had received initial health screening, 
Kato said, a process that identified 273 people for testing. Of that 
smaller group, 31 results had been received so far, revealing the 10 
confirmed cases.   The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is seeking information about the Australians on board the ship.   Fears
 had been raised about the supply of food to those onboard, but a 
Princess Cruises spokesman said the ship plans to proceed to Yokohama 
where food, provisions, and other supplies will be brought 
onboard.    People are transferred from cruise ship

 Briton, David Abel, who is on board with his wife Sally, both from 
Oxfordshire, has described the strict quarantine measures on the 
vessel.    'We are now officially in quarantine. It appears 
that our quarantine is on board the ship, that we will not be taken off 
to a hospital.' Mr Abel said in a Facebook video.   'The 10 people 
that are affected, they are being taken off very soon by the local 
coastguard into a medical facility. We are to remain on board the ship 
and we are confined to our cabins.'     Health Minister 
Kato said that officials would continue to monitor the remaining 
passengers and crew for the potential development of symptoms, 
suggesting that more test samples could be taken.    None of 
the 10 infected people, three of whom are Japanese nationals, had severe
 symptoms, public broadcaster NHK reported.    A health 
ministry official said not everyone would be tested with PCR (polymerase
 chain reaction) kits because it was too time-consuming and deemed 
unnecessary.    A look inside the ship where 10 people have been quarantined. Screening began on Tuesday for some 3,700 passengers and crew   Officers

 Japan, the local unit of the British-American cruise operator Carnival 
Corp, said on Tuesday the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by 
about 24 hours. It was not immediately available for comment on 
Wednesday.   Carnival's Princess Cruises Japan said on Tuesday that 
cruises scheduled to depart from Yokohama and the western Japanese port 
of Kobe this week would be cancelled because of delays related to the 
coronavirus checks.   The new cases bring the total number of 
confirmed cases to 33 in Japan. The epidemic, which originated in 
China's Hubei province, has killed hundreds of people and infected more 
than 10,000 so far.    Speaking yesterday, Mr Abel said the 
crew of the Diamond Princess had imposed strict hygiene measures with 
tourists warned to avoid public toilets - but claimed that some of his 
fellow passengers 'don't give a damn about personal health'.    David

is able to book onward flights as we have no idea when the quarantine 
will clear,' said Mr Abel, who is travelling with his wife and described
 himself as a 'captive' on the ship.    'The whole ship is in quarantine, we are in the middle of the bay, anchored, so nobody can get on or off this ship.    'My guess is we are going to be here throughout the whole of the day and the night.'   Praising
 the crew, he said staff had imposed stringent hygiene measures under 
which passengers had to wash their hands in sight of a staff member 
before eating.    'Staff are constantly cleaning and sanitizing
 public areas such as handrails and door handles. Passengers are 
requested not to use public toilets unless in emergency,' he 
said.      However, Mr Abel also accused some of his 
fellow passengers of increasing the risk of infection with poor personal
 hygiene.    'Some of the passengers on board just don't give a damn about personal health,' he said.     In
 one case, an American tourist had blown his nose on a napkin and 
left it on a dinner table where waiters carrying food were likely to 
touch it, he said.    It is not yet known exactly how the virus spreads.     The

 than 4,000 international students have signed a petition to delay the 
start of the university semester due to the governmentas ongoing travel 
ban on people travelling through China.   Classes at a range of 
Australian universities are due to start in February, despite the 
governmentas announcement that any foreign nationals who have travelled 
through China since 1 February will be banned from entering Australia 
for 14 days.   On Tuesday, the petition started by the general 
secretary of the University of Sydneyas student representative council, 
Abbey Shi, gathered more than 4,000 signatures,  reported   the student newspaper, Honi Soit .   The petition asks for classes at Sydney University, scheduled to start on 24 February, to be pushed back to 9 March.   In
 a statement, the president of the student representative council, Liam 
Donohoe, said the ban would unfairly disadvantage international students
 returning for the start of the year.   aThis travel ban will 
significantly disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, who 
are central to student communities at the University of Sydney and 
beyond,a he said. aMany of these students are losing out on learning, 
work, relationships, and communities, and may never return.a   Nearly  100,000 Chinese international students 
 with valid student visas are currently outside of Australia, according 
to the latest figures from the department of home affairs. Currently, 
58,797 Chinese international students are within Australia.   Monash University in Melbourne announced on Friday  it would delay its semester by one week , until 9 March.   The president of the National Union of Students, Molly Willmott, told Guardian Australia she supported the delay.   aI
 havenat seen the petition itself, but I think there are wider issues 
with the travel ban. A lot of experts have come out and said it was an 
overstep.a   The World Health Organisation said on Friday that  it did not recommend travel restrictions , but prime minister Scott Morrison said the ban was based on advice from Australian medical experts.   aWhat
 the petition is indicative of is the government making decisions 
without consulting international students or thinking about the 
long-term impact it can have on students,a Willmott said.   aWhat 
happens when you are quarantining students for two weeks? Are there 
support services in place to support them in that? It is an incredibly 
stressful and literally isolating time for students. We have to make 
sure our student services and counselling services are fully funded and 
have the right resources.a   Donohoe said that many of the students 
who had been blocked ahavenat been to Wuhan or other affected areasa, 
which made the restrictions aparticularly callousa.   On Tuesday, it
 was reported that 70 international students, some of whom had already 
been en route to Australia when the travel ban was announced,  had been detained  upon arrival at Sydney airport.   The
 University of Sydney student union, along with the New South Wales 
branch of the National Tertiary Education Union are organising a protest
 calling for a ahealth-based policy response to the coronavirusa, rather
 than aan approach based on fear and sinophobiaa.   A University of 
Sydney spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald the university had no 
plans to delay semester but was aaware of the petition and understand 
the anxiety and concerna of students.   The university has however 
extended the period that students can enrol by two weeks a until 9 March
 a and will let affected international students defer their studies for 
the semester.   The University of Melbourne also said it would not delay semester, but would aconsider special arrangements for studentsa.   The two universities, and many others, are also offering online replacements for classes.   The
 chair of Universities Australia, Prof Deborah Terry, said in a 
statement that universities were aworking round the clocka and would 
aextend the greatest flexibility possiblea.   aWe want to ensure as 
little disruption as possible to your studies a so please keep in touch 
with your university here in Australia as we keep you updated,a she 
said. aYou are a vital part of our vibrant, warm, global community of 
students and scholars.a   The president of the University of 
Melbourneas student union, Hannah Buchan, said it was important that ano
 student should be disadvantaged by this travel bana.   aI believe 
that universities need to provide more support for students who are 
affected by the ban, such as extending special consideration, providing 
online materials for the beginning of the semester for all courses, and 
providing advocacy and counselling services in different languages,a she
 said.  "
1436111322,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00271-6,2020-02-05,"3D printing gets bigger, faster and stronger"," As a metal platform rises from a vat of 
liquid resin, it pulls an intricate white shape from the liquid a like a
 waxy creature emerging from a lagoon. This machine is the worldas 
fastest resin-based 3D printer and it can create a plastic structure as 
large as a person in a few hours, says Chad Mirkin, a chemist at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The machine, which Mirkin
 and his colleagues reported last October  1  ,
 is one of a slew of research advances in 3D printing that are 
broadening the prospects of a technology once viewed as useful mainly 
for making small, low-quality prototype parts. Not only is 3D printing 
becoming faster and producing larger products, but scientists are coming
 up with innovative ways to print and are creating stronger materials, 
sometimes mixing multiple materials in the same product.   Sportswear
 firms, aviation and aerospace manufacturers and medical-device 
companies are eager to take advantage. aYouare not going to be sitting 
in your home, printing out exactly what you want to repair your car any 
time soon, but major manufacturing companies are really adopting this 
technology,a says Jennifer Lewis, a materials scientist at Harvard 
University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   The latest techniques 
could be lucrative for researchers, many of whom a Lewis and Mirkin 
among them a are already commercializing their work. Theyare also 
fundamentally exciting, says Iain Todd, a metallurgist at the University
 of Sheffield, UK. aWe can get performance out of these materials that 
we didnat think we could get. Thatas whatas really exciting to a 
materials scientist. This is getting people used to the new weird.a   The
 3D printing technique is also referred to as aadditive manufacturinga, 
because instead of chopping or milling a shape out of a larger block, or
 casting molten material in a mould, it involves building objects from 
the bottom up. Its advantages include less waste and an ability to print
 custom designs, such as intricate lattice structures, that are 
otherwise hard to create. Low-cost hobbyist machines print by squeezing 
out thin plastic filaments from heated nozzles, building up a structure 
layer by layer a a method known as fused deposition modelling (FDM). But
 the term 3D printing encompasses a much wider range of techniques. One 
of the oldest uses an ultraviolet laser to scan across and solidify (or 
acurea) light-sensitive resin, layer by layer. That concept was 
described as far back as 1984, in a patent filed by Charles Hull  2  , the founder of a company called 3D Systems in Rock Hill, South Carolina.   The
 latest techniques a including Mirkinas a still use light-sensitive 
resin, but are faster and larger-scale, following improvements reported 
in 2015 by a team led by Joseph DeSimone, a chemist and materials 
scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  3  .
 Early printers were slow, small-scale and prone to producing layered, 
imperfect and weak structures. These found a niche in rapid prototyping,
 making plastic model parts as mock-ups for later production by 
conventional methods. As an area of research, this kind of printing 
wasnat thrilling, says Timothy Scott, a polymer scientist at Monash 
University in Melbourne, Australia: aBasically making trinkets and 
knick-knacks. For a polymer chemist, it was pretty dull.a         In 2015, Joseph DeSimone at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill unveiled a technique to speed up 3D printing.  Credit: Carbon 3D Inc.    Then DeSimone unveiled a way to  print light-sensitive resin up to 100 times faster  than conventional printers  3  .
 It uses a stage submerged in a vat of resin. A digital projector shines
 a pre-programmed image up at the stage through a transparent window in 
the floor of the vat. The light cures an entire resin layer at once. 
DeSimoneas advance was to make the window permeable to oxygen. This 
kills the curing reaction and creates a thin buffer layer, or adead 
zonea, just above the windowas surface so that the resin doesnat stick 
to the bottom of the vat each time a layer is printed. The stage rises 
continually, pulling the completed part up through the liquid as new 
layers are added at the bottom.   Other labs were working on similar
 concepts at the time, says Lewis. But perhaps most impressive about 
DeSimoneas resins was that they could undergo a second reaction in a 
post-print heat treatment to strengthen the finished product. aIt opens 
up a much broader array of materials,a says Lewis.   Many research 
groups and firms have since built on the work. Mirkinas printer pumps a 
layer of clear oil across the bottom of the vat to inhibit the polymeras
 reactions. This also acts as a coolant, removing heat that can deform a
 printed part a and it means that the equipment is not limited to 
printing with resins that are inhibited by oxygen. He says the printer 
produces material ten times faster than DeSimoneas. And last January, 
Scott and his colleague Mark Burns at the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor reported a printer that inhibits the reactions by mixing into the 
resin a chemical that can be activated by a second lamp emitting a 
different wavelength of light  4  .
 By varying the ratio of the strength of the two light sources, the 
researchers can control the thickness of the photo-inhibited zone, 
allowing the creation of more complicated patterns, such as surfaces 
embossed with seals or logos.   Inventions in 3D printing often have
 rapid commercial potential: some researchers start forming companies 
before they publish their advances. On the same day DeSimoneas paper was
 published, for instance, he  showcased it at a TED talk 
 in Vancouver, Canada, and officially launched his start-up firm Carbon 
3D in Redwood City, California, although he had quietly registered the 
company two years earlier. The firm is now one of the biggest start-ups 
in 3D printing; it has already raised US$680 million in publicly

have also launched a start-up, Azul 3D in Evanston, Illinois, to 
commercialize their technique, which they have dubbed HARP (high-area 
rapid printing). And Scott and Burns are preparing a commercial 
prototype printer with their Ann Arbor-based start-up Diplodocal, a name
 derived from the Greek for adouble beama.   New resin-printing 
techniques are still emerging. One begins with a small spinning glass 
holding liquid resin. As the glass rotates, a projector shines a loop of
 video onto it that corresponds to 2D slices of the desired object. 
Within seconds, the final object solidifies inside the liquid resin a no
 layers necessary  5  .
 The method is inspired by X-rays and computed-tomography scans, which 
image a cross-section of a solid object. This is the inverse: 
back-projecting cross-sections to form a 3D object.        A projector shines a video loop onto liquid resin, causing an entire object to be created at once, rather than layer by layer.  Credit: UC Berkeley    Even in this fast-moving field, the  technique turned heads 
 for what Lewis calls athe gee-whiz factora. It has significant 
limitations: the resin used must be transparent, and the printed object 
must be small enough for light to pass through it to cure it. But it 
also has a potential advantage: it can handle highly viscous resins, 
which other resin-based printers struggle to suck through the narrow 
dead zone. That means it could make stronger materials and more accurate
 prints.   The approach has garnered substantial interest from 
industry, says Christopher Spadaccini, a materials and manufacturing 
engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California.
 Spadaccini was a member of the team that published the work last 
January  5  .
 A group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)
 independently developed the same concept, and has also reported a 
demonstration of it  6  .
 Spadaccini thinks the technology has tremendous commercial potential 
because it has modest hardware requirements. aIn the end, really, what 
you need is a halfway-decent projector and a rotating stage,a he says.   While
 chemists work on smarter ways to 3D-print intricate resins, engineers 
are pushing boundaries in 3D printing of concrete a using computers and 
robots to precisely automate the pouring process.        A 3D-printed concrete pedestrian bridge developed by Tsinghua University.  Credit: Imaginechina/Shutterstock    The worldas first 3D-printed concrete pedestrian bridge was 
made by researchers at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of 
Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain, and installed in a park in Alcobendas, 
near Madrid, in 2016. Twelve metres long, the bridge features a lattice 
structure designed with algorithms that maximize strength and reduce the
 amount of material needed. Other teams have made similar structures, 
including a 26-metre-long bridge in Shanghai, China, produced by 
engineers at Tsinghua University in Beijing. And teams and companies in 
China and the Netherlands have 3D printed demonstration houses.   Those
 structures arenat constructed in one print job, however: separate 
segments are printed and then connected. By producing bridges and houses
 more cheaply and efficiently, 3D printing could reduce concreteas 
carbon footprint a but it could also just encourage engineers to build 
more.   Itas not just concrete that is going big: Amsterdam firm 
MX3D has printed a bridge from stainless steel. First displayed publicly
 in 2018, the bridge is now being tested and having sensors installed 
ahead of a planned installation over an Amsterdam canal.        A view of MX3Das printer during the process of printing a metal bridge.  Credit: Olivier de Gruijter/MX3D    And California start-up firm Relativity Space in Los Angeles
 says it is constructing a nearly fully 3D-printed rocket. The rocket is
 designed to lift 1,250akilograms into low Earth orbit, and its first 
test launch is slated for 2021. Printed metal doesnat always have the 
same heat-dissipating performance as non-printed metal, says Relativity 
Spaceas chief executive, Tim Ellis, but the printing process can add 
cooling channels in geometries that canat usually be manufactured. 
Because rockets are used only once or perhaps a few times, they donat 
have to be as strong in the long term as do alloys in aeroplane parts, 
which must resist failure over tens of thousands of pressure cycles, 
Ellis says.        A metal printer at start-up firm Relativity Space, which aims to test a mostly 3D-printed rocket in 2021.  Credit: Relativity Space    These large-scale metal-printed projects are built with 
robot arms that feed a thin metal wire to a laser that welds the 
material into place. Other established ways to print metal use a laser 
or a beam of electrons to melt or fuse a bed of powder into layers of 
finished product. Another technique binds a bed of powder with liquid 
glue, then sinters the structure in a furnace. And printers designed in 
the past few years extrude molten metals through nozzles, in much the 
same way as in FDM.   Aviation firms such as Boeing, Rolls Royce and
 Pratt &amp; Whitney are using 3D printing to make metal parts, mainly 
for jet engines. It can be cheaper than milling metal blocks, and the 
intricate components often weigh less than their conventionally made 
counterparts.   But 3D-printed metals are prone to defects that can 
weaken the final products. Spadaccini and others are trying to use 
arrays of sensors and high-speed cameras to watch for irregularities 
such as hotspots of heat or strain a and then make adjustments in real 
time, he says.   Many scientists are also hoping to improve the 
intrinsic strength of printed metals, sometimes by controlling the 
microstructures of the materials. For instance, in October 2017, a US 
team reported that the intense heat and rapid cooling used in 
3D-printing stainless steel could alter the metalas microstructure such 
that the product is stronger than those cast conventionally  7  .
 And two months ago, researchers in Australia and the United States 
reported a titaniumacopper alloy with similar strength advantages  8  .
 As they solidified, previous 3D-printed titanium alloys tended to form 
grains that grew in column-like structures. The copper helps to speed up
 the solidification process, which results in grains that are smaller 
and sprout in all directions, strengthening the overall structure.   Mark
 Easton, a materials engineer at RMIT University in Melbourne and one of
 the leaders of the alloy work, has already had conversations with 
aerospace companies interested in exploring uses for the material. He 
says it could also be used in medical implants such as joint 
replacements.   Many of the printing techniques that work for metals
 can also be applied to ceramics, with potential applications that 
include making dental crowns or orthopaedic implants. Moulds for these 
objects are already made by 3D printing, with the material cast in the 
conventional way. But 3D-printing the entire object could save time at 
the dentist or surgeonas office.   However, it is harder to control 
the microstructure of 3D-printed ceramics, says Eduardo Saiz, a 
materials scientist and ceramicist at Imperial College London. And 
nearly all practical ceramic printing techniques involve extensive 
post-print sintering that can warp or deform the part. aIn my opinion, 
ceramics is way behind polymers and metals in terms of practical 
applications,a he says.   The 
fieldas future could also lie in a4D printinga a 3D-printed objects that
 also have the ability to perform some mechanical action, akin to 
artificial muscles. Often, these incorporate shape-memory polymers, 
materials that can react to changes in their environment such as heat or
 moisture.   In May 2018, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute
 of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and the California Institute of 
Technology in Pasadena reported printing a submarine that propels itself
 forward using paddles that snap backwards when placed in warm water  9  .
 The work could lead to microrobots that can explore the oceans 
autonomously. But for the moment, the paddles must be reset after each 
stroke. Such devices could use battery power to reset themselves, but 
that makes the machine less efficient than one made conventionally, says
 Geoff Spinks, a materials engineer at the University of Wollongong in 
Australia. aThere are still some big challenges with 4D printing,a he 
says.   Another approach to 4D-printed devices involves triggering 
the action with a changing external magnetic field. US researchers have 
3D-printed lattice structures filled with a liquid that changes 
stiffness in response to a magnetic field  10   a which could perhaps be used to help car seats stiffen on impact.        A fluid that stiffens in response to a magnetic field is 
injected into the hollow struts and beams of a 3D-printed lattice. The 
material can be made stiff or flexible.  Credit: Julie Mancini/LLNL    Other, more passive potential 4D printing applications 
include stents, which could be compressed to be implanted then expanded 
on reaching the desired site in a blood vessel to prop it open. Last 
July, researchers in Switzerland and Italy described a 4D-printed stent 
that is just 50 micrometres wide  11  ,
 much smaller than conventional ones. The devices are so small, the team
 says, they could one day be used to treat complications in fetuses, 
such as strictures in the urinary tract, which can sometimes be fatal.   Perhaps
 the most ambitious example of 4D printing is matter that not only 
moves, but is alive. Currently, techniques for such bioprinting can 
print tissue, such as human skin, that is suitable for lab research, as 
well as patches of tissue for livers and other organs that have been 
successfully implanted in rats. But such techniques are still far from 
ready to integrate into a human body. Researchers dream of printing 
fully functioning organs that could alleviate long wait lists for organ 
donors. aI personally feel weare a decade-plus away from that, at least,
 if ever,a says Lewis.   Many 
inventive ideas about printing matter that moves or changes rely on 
printing multiple materials together. aThatas absolutely where the field
 is heading,a says Scott.   
   Last November, Lewis and her lab described a printer that can 
rapidly switch between different polymer inks or mix them as it prints a
 single object  12  .
 This means objects can be printed with both flexible and rigid parts. 
Lewis has spun off previous work on multi-material printers into a firm 
called Voxel8, a start-up in Somerville, Massachusetts. Her 
multi-material printer could help with the athletics wear that Voxel8 is
 developing, says Lewis. Wearable devices need to be flexible around 
joints while also having rigid parts to house electronics. Saiz calls 
the printer abeautiful worka, adding wistfully: aThereas nothing like 
that for ceramics or metal.a   And in March 2018, a team led by Jerry Qi, a materials engineer at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta,  unveiled a four-in-one printer .
 This combines a nozzle that extrudes molten polymer with one that 
prints light-sensitive resin, ready to be cured by ultraviolet lamps or 
lasers, and two that print wires and circuitry from tiny dots of metal  13  .
 The print heads work together to make integrated devices with circuits 
embedded on a rigid board or inside a flexible polymer enclosure. Qi 
says his group is now collaborating with electronics companies 
interested in printing circuit-board prototypes faster than conventional
 methods.   It wasnat as simple as bolting four different printers 
into one platform: the researchers also needed to develop software that 
would allow each print head to communicate with the others and keep 
track of the progress.   The field is still far from delivering on 
early visions of bringing mass manufacturing into peopleas homes. For 
now, sophisticated printers are too expensive to appeal to 
non-specialists. But 3D printing has come a long way in the past 20 
years. Todd remembers people touring his lab in the early 2000s to see 
his technique to fuse specks of metal dust together to grow parts. 
Compared with the conventional milling machines and metal-cutting 
systems in neighbouring labs, his 3D-printing machines struck visitors 
as a complete oddity. aIt was like we were some sort of a dog playing a 
piano in a bar,a he recalls. Now, for many firms, that trick is standard
 practice.  "

 flight touched down on Wednesday, with passengers from New Zealand and 
the Pacific Islands immediately taken to Whangaparaoa military base

 Air New Zealand flight (pictured) carrying 198 people from Wuhan, the 
epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, has landed in Auckland   The
 flight (pictured) touched down on Wednesday and passengers from New 
Zealand and the Pacific Islands were immediately taken to Whangaparaoa 
military base for a 14-day quarantine   So far, there have 
been no confirmed cases of coronavirus infection among the men, women 
and children already on the island, where they are being held for up to 
two weeks.   A team of specialist doctors and nurses is closely monitoring the evacuees.   Up
 to 600 Australians initially registered for the evacuation flights home
 but some have decided to remain in Wuhan. It is not clear how many will
 join the next flight.   Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the plan was for passengers to be isolated in small family groups on Christmas Island.   'There won't be a full mingling,' he said in Canberra on Monday.   'If
 someone does get unwell their family might have to start again for 14 
days but we wouldn't want to expose the whole group to that.'   However since the first evacuees landed on Christmas Island the escapees have been left than impressed by the conditions.    Evacuees
 claim they are now being forced to stay in cockroach-infested rooms, 
with some of the 84 children on the island 'too scared to touch 
their beds'.   The 35 Australians on board the flight were 
taken directly to Christmas Island, a former off-shore detention 
facility. Pictured: Australians already under quarantine on the island   'The
 hygiene issues make it worse than a prison. I understood that there 
would be very limited facilities here, but the actual condition is no 
facilities at all,' evacuee Belinda Chen told the  ABC.      Ms
 Chen, who is staying at the centre with her two kids, said the 
conditions were 'thousands of times worse' than what she imagined.   'I felt sick when I walked into the bathroom, there were bugs and flies everywhere,' she said.   Another evacuee said it felt like they were being treated like 'a group of animals'.     'It's
 even more dangerous than staying in Wuhan, it is life-threatening 
conditions here, it is worse than self-isolation in Wuhan,' the person, 
who chose to remain anonymous, said.    There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Zealand at this stage   Other families claimed the cots provided for their babies were dirty and the linen hadn't been washed.   Photos
 of the housing unit show plain steel bunk beds with mini fridges and 
shelving, while the shared bathrooms have metal toilets with plastic 
lids.   Another woman said the facility looked 'completely different' from the photos evacuees were shown by the Government.   The
 evacuees were given a brochure written in simplified Chinese saying 
they would be provided with 'every facility and service' they needed 
while on the island.   Australians were also evacuated from the city earlier this week before being taken to Christmas Island   Some
 evacuees have struggled to get in contact with their families as there 
is little to no mobile reception on the island, which is located 
1500km west of mainland Australia.   A $10 credit for the centre's 
phones was handed out to the evacuees in case they needed a doctor in 
the middle of the night.    But others said the state of the facility were 'acceptable' and 'very simple but clean'.   Sydney resident Gloria Zeng said there was a large courtyard with grass for kids to run around on.    She
 also said staff painted a welcome sign to greet the evacuees with when 
they arrived in the early hours of Tuesday morning.    However - it is unlikely many more will be joining them.    The prime minister warned Australians still in Wuhan that a second assisted evacuation flight home could possibly be the last.   Evacuees
 claim they are now being forced to stay in cockroach-infested rooms, 
with some of the 84 children on the island 'too scared to touch their 
beds'   'What I want to tell people is that they can't count on a further flight beyond that,' he told Nine Network.    The details of the second evacuation flight are still to be negotiated with Chinese authorities.    The
 death toll from coronavirus in China has now passed 490, while there 
are now more than 24,000 confirmed cases on the mainland.    There are no confirmed cases of the virus in New Zealand.   Australia
 confirmed a 13th case of the illness on Tuesday after an eight-year-old
 boy in Queensland was confirmed to have the illness.    He was part of a tour group where two other people, both in their 40s, were diagnosed with coronavirus.   All three are in a stable condition at Gold Coast University Hospital.       NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15           "

 this week, 243 Australians arrived in the country after being evacuated
 from Wuhan, and all but two were taken to the Indian Ocean territory to
 be quarantined for two weeks.    A further 35 will soon be transferred from Auckland to the tiny island off the northwest coast of Western Australia.     Evacuees
 are being kept at the Christmas Island immigration detention facility, 
which is located well away from the main population centre, and has a 
capacity of 2,700.    There have been no confirmed cases of

would  report on how much hazard reduction the states carried out each  year.   Speaking
 in parliament on Wednesday, Morrison said hazard reduction was at least
 as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to protect people as 
fire seasons worsened.   The University of Melbourne  desktop analysis used Rural Fire Service data 
 to compare the size and severity of this seasonas bushfires area with 
hazard reduction burns over the past five years. The majority of the 
area in which there had been prescribed burning had been razed again by 
bushfire in the past three months.   Patrick Baker, a professor of 
silviculture and forest ecology, said the prescribed burning did not 
aseem to have done much at alla in areas that faced a crowning bushfire 
that burned the canopy.   He said the fire that devastated the NSW 
south coast between Batemans Bay and Jervis Bay over the new year scored
 3.95 out of 4 on a severity scale despite recent hazard reduction burns
 in the area, some of which scored up to 3.8. aPretty much the whole 
area was torched,a Baker said.   The analysis found prescribed 
burning was likely to have helped save property in areas on the fringe 
of major fire complexes where the flames were less severe, such as 
Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.   Baker said it suggested prescribed
 burning was most effective when used as part of a risk-based system 
designed to help protect chosen assets a human life, biodiversity, 
property and water catchments a rather than based on an arbitrary 
numeric target. He said a 5% annual target risked leading to swathes of 
remote landscape being burned without significantly reducing the risk to
 assets.   In Victoria, for example, burning the sandy soiled 
landscape in the Mallee, which makes up nearly a fifth of the state, 
would do little to protect assets but could have a catastrophic impact 
on native animals and plants, he said.   aWe need to be smart about 
where we burn,a Baker said. aThe other issue is we donat have endless 
resources to do this. Itas extraordinarily expensive, so if people want 
to double or triple or quadruple prescribed burning, the question is 
what else are we not going to get done?a   Morrison announced on 
Tuesday that former a defence chief, Mark Binskin, would lead a royal 
commission into the bushfire crisis, which has claimed 33 lives, 
destroyed thousands of homes and is estimated to have killed more than 
1bn animals.   Scientists and former emergency service chiefs say 
the climate crisis has exacerbated fire risk and reduced the window each
 year in which hazard reduction burning can be safely carried out. They 
say the increased threat demands both greater resources to fight fires 
and urgent action to cut emissions.   A group of 31 ex-fire and 
emergency bosses will write to Morrison on Thursday saying the royal 
commission will be a waste of time and money if it does not examine the 
role of climate change.   In a statement released on Wednesday 
night, Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, said: 
aClimate change has increased fire danger so much that fires now burn 
freely through areas that have undergone hazard reduction burning 
recently. I saw fires a metre high burning across mown lawns while 
fighting fires at Batemans Bay on New Yearas Eve.a   The current 
Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told the ABC on 
Wednesday that, while some objected to the description,  the ongoing fire crisis was clearly unprecedented .
 He said no fire season had taken as many lives, destroyed as many homes
 and burned through a quarter of the stateas forested country across the
 Great Dividing Range. aThe reality is it has been an extraordinary, 
difficult, damaging, destructive, fatal and tragic fire season, and it 
is without precedent,a he said.   The 5% annual hazard reduction 
target was recommended by the royal commission into the 2009 Black 
Saturday bushfires in Victoria, which killed 173 people. Neil Comrie, a 
former Victoria police chief commissioner who was appointed to oversee 
implementation of the royal commissionas recommendations, later found 
the target was likely to not be achievable, affordable or sustainable, 
and the primary focus should be protection of lives and communities.   The
 Victorian Andrews government dropped the 5% goal and adopted a 
risk-based approach in 2016, pledging to focus on reducing fuel loads 
close to communities and in remote back-country areas where fires can 
start, grow and build in intensity.   John Thwaites, a former 
Victorian deputy premier and environment minister and now the chairman 
of Monash Sustainable Development Institute, said despite claims the 
states were not doing enough, fuel reduction had risen 61% in Victoria 
in the decade following the Black Saturday fires compared with the 
previous 10 years.   Even with that increase, the state  met its increased hazard reduction targets only twice 
 before moving to the risk-based system three years ago. It planned to 
burn 246,000 hectares in 2019, but managed little more than half that 
because it was not safe to burn, officials said.   In NSW, both the 
National Parks and Wildlife Service and Rural Fire Service met 
hectare-based targets for fuel reduction last year, but the rural 
service fell short of a goal of limiting fire hazards around 113,130 
properties.   Thwaites said higher temperatures, drier fuel and 
stronger winds were increasingly making it unsafe to burn in autumn and 
spring, but a risk-based approach using sophisticated modelling such as 
that being adopted in Victoria would reduce the likelihood that homes 
were lost.  "

 bar and its promoters have been slammed as being 'insensitive' and 
'racist' after launching their Corona Chinese New Year Special event 
with $8 Corona beers and face masks.      Melbourne 
 cocktail bar Pawn &amp; Co and their promotional company Mr Chan's 
advertised the event, which also featured 'Happy Ending cocktails' on 
Facebook.   But the promotion quickly backfired and the company were forced to apologise.    Melbourne
 cocktail bar Pawn &amp; Co and promotional marketing company Mr Chan's 
have been slammed for an 'insensitive', 'offensive' and 'racist' 
promotion using the novel coronavirus as a marketing tool (pictured)   President
 of the Chinese-Australia Friendship Association Anthony Leong described
 the event as 'ignorant, racist and insensitive',  ABC News  reported.    'I
 was surprised that somebody, anybody, could be so insensitive and 
ignorant in terms of profiting from this and thinking it was funny,' Mr 
Leong said.   'I think the timing is not just ill-conceived and insulting, it also shows a lack of knowledge, empathy and humanity.'    Following the backlash both businesses pulled the event and were forced to apologise.    'From
 the team at Pawn &amp; Co, we would like to unreservedly apologise for 
the insensitive and inappropriate marketing that has been circulated by 
Mr Chan's,' a Pawn &amp; Co statement read.    'Whilst it is an
 external promotional company that owns the Mr Chans brand, we 
acknowledge that we should have been more active in understanding the 
communication being marketed and how it might be perceived.   'We will immediately look to make changes here that reflect the values of our venue, team and the broader community.'    Mr Chan's also released a statement apologising for the marketing stunt.    Mr
 Chan's was set to host the 'Corona Chinese New Year Special' at 
the Pawn &amp; Co (pictured) which was offering $8 Corona beers, free 
face masks and 'happy ending' cocktails before they were slammed 
by the Chinese-Australia Friendship Association   'We 
recognise that a promotional post that was made last week was offensive 
and we unreservedly apologise for this,' the statement read.   'We also recognise that some of our past promotional material was inappropriate, once again we apologise for this.    'We
 are taking action and reviewing the Mr Chan's branding immediately, it 
is important for us to run a night that is inclusive for all.'    Since the post Mr Chan's has deactivated its Instagram account.    Mr Leong said the apologies were 'too little too late'.   'They
 need to be held to account. To make light of something that has been 
fatal to hundreds of people is the height of inhumanity and 
insensitivity,' he said.   Despite the backlash against both businesses a large number of the comments from social media users supported them.   'Clearly being comical in all the promotions it's not like you guys design promos to target and offend,' one user wrote.    'I
 think your Facebook posts are fantastic. Itas entertaining and 
refreshing seeing the way you guys approach your marketing,' another 
added.    Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Leong for further comment.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

funding in response to the outbreak.   She says the tourism industry
 is being bled dry by travel bans with the Cairns region alone losing 
$200 million in forward bookings, and exporters including seafood 
producers who service  China  losing their entire markets.   Jobs
 could go within weeks unless the federal government stumps up cash to 
help businesses survive the coronavirus outbreak (pictured is an

and months. I think this is something that we have to act on very, very 
quickly,' she told ABC television on Thursday.   'The last thing we want to see is job losses as a result ... I can't understand why you would not help in a time of crisis.'   The
 premier says she received a firm no when she wrote to Prime Minister 
Scott Morrison, asking him to treat the outbreak as a disaster and 
activate recovery funds usually reserved for events like fires and 
floods.   Viral outbreaks and pandemics are not currently covered by
 natural disaster relief funding, which is underpinned by an agreement 
between the states and the Commonwealth.   Any push to change that would require a renegotiation of that agreement.   AAP has asked the federal government what other forms of assistance are available to industries affected by the outbreak.   Queensland
 now has four confirmed cases of coronavirus (pictured). All of the 
infected people are from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the 
outbreak, and were travelling together in a tour group   Meanwhile,
 Queensland's Economic Functional Recovery Group has been mobilised and 
will meet with the government on Thursday to discuss assistance 
measures.   The premier has said that might range from possible tax and fee relief to storing surplus seafood intended for export markets.   Reserve
 Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe has warned coronavirus could 
cause a sharp slow down in economic growth in China, Australia's biggest
 trading partner.   Queensland now has four confirmed cases of coronavirus.   All

 the ABC has screened footage of China's women's soccer team being 
released from a Brisbane hotel after almost two weeks in quarantine.   The team was confined to the hotel as a precaution after arriving in Australia via Wuhan.   The virus has infected about 25,000 people worldwide, and killed about 500 people, almost all of them in China.

The
 man, who worked as a health and safety advisor for Qantas, told other 
employees they could strike if they had concerns working on planes that 
had come from Beijing or Shanghai.     The employee, who 
was also a union delegate from the Transport Workers Union, was stood 
down on Sunday after his claims were dismissed by Qantas.   The 
airline said employees and passengers who boarded planes from China were
 at a 'very low' risk of contracting the virus.     A
 union delegate from the Transport Workers Union (TWU) told other Qantas
 employees that it was unsafe to board any planes that had come from 
Beijing or Shanghai and was let go by Qantas over the weekend   On
 Alan Jones' Breakfast show on 2GB on Thursday, the broadcaster read a 
letter from Qantas warning two cleaners they could be fired for refusing
 to board a plane.     '(The employees) refused to board 
an aircraft and perform your duties. You advised this was due to your 
concerns of the risk of contracting coronavirus,' Mr Jones said while 
reading the letter.   'You were advised at the time that the risk of
 that occurring was negligible. In these circumstances and with the 
information available to you, you can not reasonably be concerned that 
working on an aircraft originating from China would expose you to a 
serious risk to your health or safety.'   'If you fail to comply 
with this direction it may result in disciplinary action taken against 
you up to and including termination of your employment.'   The
 worker was telling other staff it was unsafe to board Qantas planes 
from Shanghai and Beijing due to the risk of contracting coronavirus   Dr Russell Brown, who works in Qantas' Medical team, said the risk of contracting the virus was very low.    'We would never ask our employees to work in unsafe conditions,' Dr Russell said in a statement.   'The
 TWU knows full well that the risk of aviation workers contracting 
coronavirus as a result of working on an aircraft originating from China
 is very low. I briefed them on the situation last week.   'Our 
medical team is in regular contact with health authorities and is 
receiving the latest advice from Australia's Chief Medical Officer and 
the World Health Organisation.   'Additional protective measures are
 being put in place on flights from China to further reduce the risk of 
our employees contracting coronavirus and we are providing them with 
regular updates on the latest health advice.'   But TWU National 
Secretary Michael Kaine defended the union delegate who was let go, 
saying their concerns were reasonable.     Passengers in Auckland airport wearing face masks amid the new arrivals from the epicentre of coronavirus   'We
 rightly lauded the actions of Qantas in sending in a rescue mission and
 we support the brave volunteers on that flight but there's a double 
standard here isn't there,' Mr Kaine said on 2GB Radio.   'These 
workers know that these planes have come in from the epicentre of the 
virus, they have to go home to their families at night thinking that 
they may be potentially infected.   'It's a reasonable concern, 
people are dying left right and centre. How is it unreasonable to be 
concerned about your health and safety? You can imagine there's a level 
of anxiety that goes with it.'    On Monday a Qantas flight 
from the Chinese province of Wuhan landed in Western Australia carrying 
hundreds of Australian evacuees.   Evacuees have since been flown to Christmas Island where they are to be quarantined for two weeks.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

It comes as health authorities confirmed the 14th case of the deadly virus in Australia, as the death tolls nears 500 worldwide.   In
 a series of messages seen by Daily Mail Australia, Chinese 
students admit rushing to 'visa-free' countries to get around the ban - 
and enter Australia as soon as possible.    More than 100,000 Chinese students are locked out of Australia after the government brought in an emergency ban.   Passengers

 stops people coming into the country if they've been in China within 14
 days, as the government scramble to stop the virus spreading.    In
 a desperate attempt to get back on Australian soil, students are 
abusing a loophole in the emergency measure, which was introduced last 
week.   Many are booking cheap flights to holiday destinations such 
as Thailand, which has no travel ban, and spending two weeks there 
before flying onto Australia.   This meets the government's requirement that people not enter the country if they have been in China within the last 14 days.   Students
 are flocking to resorts in Thailand to ensure they can return to 
Australia as soon as possible (pictured, other passengers arriving in 
Brisbane before the ban)   It comes amid fears not enough is 
being done to protect Australians from the deadly respiratory virus, 
which has now infected more than 20,000 people worldwide.   But the 
ban has caused havoc for the thousands of Chinese students whose 
classes are due to start next week, sending Australia's higher education
 sector into chaos.    In one series of texts, which have gone 
viral on Sydney's Chinese-language media sites, one student bemoaned how
 long it was taking to get a visa.   'You can go to a visa on arrival country a Thailand, Nepal, Laos,' a friend replied.   'A lot of my friends are planning on going via Thailand. [You receive a] 15-day visa on arrival.'   Visitors
 flying in from mainland China are being denied entry to Australia. 
Pictured are passengers at Brisbane Airport on Friday, just hours before
 the ban came into place   China has gone into lockdown after the virus claimed more than 400 lives (pictured, students in Beijing)    'Iam going to check flights,' the first friend replies.   'Iave already bought one,' another said.   In a later exchange, a student said a friend had 'just popped up in Thailand' and posted a picture.    'There
 are 189,000 Chinese students right across our tertiary education 
sector,' said Education Minister Dan Tehan said over the weekend.   'Forty-four per cent of those students are onshore, 56 per cent are still offshore.'   'We're doing everything we can to ensure [international students] can either study online or study remotely.'   In
 an incriminating message (pictured) a Chinese student says he changed 
his arrival card to say 'Hong Kong' instead of 'China' as his original 
place of departure - letting him into Australia   If a traveller has been in China after February 1, they are not allowed to enter Australia   Instead, they have to leave China for at least 14 days    After those 14 days, they are then allowed to come to Australia   It hopes to stop the virus spreading across the country, but people are eagerly looking for ways to bypass the rule   Some are lying on their landing cards, and others are going to visa-free destinations - such as Thailand or Laos   After spending just two weeks there, they are free to fly to Australia   Educating international students is Australia's third biggest export, bringing billions into the economy every year.    It
 is one of several countries which has introduced a travel ban, 
alongside the United States, the UK, Singapore and New 
Zealand.     Multiple airlines have also suspended flights to and from mainland China.    But
 there are still huge numbers of countries which are allowing people to 
arrive from China, including many where students could easily move on to
 Australia.   Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia are all still allowing flights to arrive from China.   While
 Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced all border crossings with 
the mainland would be suspended, people can still travel across 
the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, Shenzhen Bay Port to and from 
Hong Kong International Airport.   Australia is one of many countries organising evacuation flights home (pictured, Singaporeans boarding a charter flight)   From Hong Kong, they can travel onto Australia.     Earlier
 this week, Daily Mail Australia exposed a worrying loophole in 
immigration screening which could expose thousands to the deadly 
illness.   One Chinese student who snuck into Australia bragged 
about how he flouted the ban, having potentially put thousands in danger
 of contracting coronavirus.   He admitted to lying to immigration 
officials by claiming he arrived from Hong Kong, when he in fact flew to
 Sydney from mainland China.    Daily Mail Australia alerted 
the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force to the 
breach, but did they did not respond to requests for comment.   The 
student, whose name was given as Xiao K, started his journey in China, 
changing planes in Hong Kong before arriving in Brisbane.   Coronavirus (pictured) has spread to more than 20 countries and killed nearly 500 people   Revealing
 he lied on his yellow incoming passenger card, he bragged that he 
quickly crossed out 'China' as his place of departure and instead wrote 
'Hong Kong'.   Worryingly, he boasted that customs officials didn't even check his luggage.   'Fortunately, they were focusing on people.   'In the end, they didn't even check my suitcase.'   The student claimed he didn't know about the ban when he first boarded a plane in an unknown Chinese airport.   He
 claimed to have thought he would have to go into isolation for 14 days 
when on Australia soil, but was soon informed about the travel ban by a 
friend.   Before going through immigration in Australian, he then exploited an airport loophole to change his arrival card.   Passengers

 disease is believed to have emerged in a market in the city of Wuhan 
that sold wild animals, spreading rapidly as people travelled for the 
Lunar New Year holiday in late January.   The virus has so far 
spread to more than 20 countries, prompting the World Health 
Organization to declare a global health emergency.   Earlier this

'The second flight that's going into Wuhan, that's being arranged now. There are 35 people who were on the flight on Air  New Zealand ,' Mr Morrison told 2GB radio on Thursday.   'We

are quarantined at the Detention Centre on Christmas Island (pictured)   On
 Wednesday evening home affairs minister Peter Dutton said that if 
Christmas Island reaches capacity then people could share rooms or stay 
in locations away from the rest of the Australian 
population.     'There are isolated mining camps or the 
prospect of hotels that you could take over. But I think we'll look at 
all of those in order of what we think is the best response, but all of 
this is in the spirit of preparation,' he told reporters.   The 
second group of Australians airlifted from the epicentre of the 
coronavirus outbreak in China are about to be put into quarantine on 
Christmas Island, as the national toll for confirmed cases hits 14.   The
 35 citizens and permanent residents left Wuhan in central China on 
Wednesday on an Air New Zealand flight evacuating 98 New Zealanders and a
 number of others to Auckland.   They are being transported from New
 Zealand on a charter flight across the Australian continent and on 
Thursday will join the 241 evacuees already undergoing a two-week 
quarantine process.   So far, there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus infection among the men, women and children already there.   Passengers arriving at Auckland International Airport on February 5, 2020 in Auckland, New Zealand on Wednesday, February 5   Flight

 had been travelling with three others from China - including an 
eight-year-old boy - who caught the virus, taking the number of 
confirmed cases in Australia to 14.   Along with the four cases in 
Queensland, there have been four each in NSW and Victoria and two in 
South Australia. Three of the 14 people have recovered and been 
released.   As well, two Australians who were travelling on a cruise
 ship off Japan have also tested positive to the deadly virus and more 
could follow.   The majority of passengers New Zealand or 
Pacific Island nationals and will be quarantined for 14 days at 
Whangaparaoa military base   The Japanese government has 
quarantined the vessel, which is carrying 223 Australians among its 2666
 guests and 1045 crew at Yokohama, south of Tokyo.   Some 492 
people, mostly in China, have died and 24,562 people have been confirmed

A woman at Auckland City Hospital in  New Zealand  heard the patient call out while being brought in for treatment at the hospital's emergency department on Tuesday morning.   The
 coronavirus has killed nearly 500 people but there have been no 
confirmed cases of the disease in New Zealand, with the witness 
describing the request as an ignorant remark.   A patient in Auckland City Hospital (pictured) was overheard requesting 'no Asian doctor' amid coronavirus fears   An
 Air New Zealand flight landed in Auckland from Wuhan on Wednesday with 
198 people on board. Pictured: passengers in Auckland airport wearing

 not sure if I would describe this as blatant racism, but there's 
definitely a lot of total ignorance out there with regards to this 
virus,' the woman - who did not wish to be named - told  The New Zealand Herald.     An Auckland
 District Health Board spokeswoman said she was unaware of the incident,
 but said there were protocols in place to treat infectious diseases.   'The
 public can be assured that robust processes are in place in our 
hospital to care for any patients with coronavirus while protecting 
patients, staff, whanau (family) and visitors,' they said.   A 
patient was brought to Auckland City Hospital last week with a suspected
 case of coronavirus, but it turned out to be negative.   China Consul General in New Zealand Ruan Ping said the fight against the disease was not an excuse for bigotry.    'Compared
 with the virus itself, ignorance, hatred and discrimination are even 
more calamitous and should not be tolerated in any part of the world,' 
Mr Ping said.   An Air New Zealand flight carrying 198 people from 
Wuhan landed in Auckland on Wednesday, with passengers on the aircraft 
being immediately taken to Whangaparaoa military base for a 14-day 
quarantine.   The 35 Australians on board were taken directly to 
Christmas Island to join the 72 people taken there on board a Qantas 
flight from the coronavirus epicentre.   One person from Hong Kong and another from the Phillippines are the only two confirmed coronavirus deaths outside of China.   There are more than 24,000 people confirmed to have the deadly disease, with 14 cases in Australia.

 of Australians are trapped on a 'floating prison' cruise ship with 
rations being delivered to their rooms after 20 travellers tested 
positive for coronavirus.   The Diamond Princess ship 
carrying 2,655 people is anchored off Yokohama, Japan where 20 
infected patients, including two Australians, have been rushed to 
hospital for treatment.   The other passengers have been told to 
stay in their cabins and are not allowed off the ship for up to two 
weeks amid fears of mass contagion.   Among them are 233 
Australians, including Olivia Capodicasa, from Melbourne, who was on the
 final night of her cruise with her grandmother when the ship was locked
 down.   She described the conditions as being like 'hell' and said she had been watching movies to pass the time.   'It has been a hell of a 24 hours stuck in here', she told Sunrise on Thursday morning.    'I think it is really starting to hit me now that this is the reality and I'm not going home anytime soon'.

 ship Diamond Princess (pictured on Wednesday) is anchored off the shore
 of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, after 20 tested positive for coronavirus   Miss
 Capodicasa said the passengers' only contact with officials has been 
through the captain who has made announcements to all the rooms. She 
said they have been asked to fill out forms if they need 
medication.     Also on board are Cairns couple Paul and Jacqui Fidrmuc who said they were holding up OK.   The
 pair told the Nine Network the ship was eerily quiet on Thursday. 'We 
are just kind of sitting tight really,' Mrs Fidrmuc said.   'It's
 a little bit daunting. But look, we can't do anything... We are good 
strong healthy people and we've got good immune systems and fingers 
crossed that ... we can fight it off.'    Olivia Capodicasa (pictured) was on the final night of her cruise with her grandmother when the ship was locked down   Cairns couple Paul and Jacqui Fidrmuc (pictured) said they were holding up OK as they were quarantined in their rooms   Brisbane couple Karen and John Welch (pictured) said they had not heard anything about when they can leave   Medical
 workers in protective suits lead a passenger tested positive for a new 
coronavirus from the cruise ship Diamond Princess at Yokohama Port on 
Wednesday   Brisbane couple Karen and John Welch said they had not heard anything about when they can leave.    'We
 have not heard a thing. I wish they would get on to the job. They need 
to get us off this ship,' Mr Welch told the Today show on Friday 
morning.   It's like a floating prison    British passenger David Abel   He said they were keeping in touch with other Aussies on the ship by phone because they are not allowed out of their rooms.   'I have spoken to quite a few Australians on the phone here. We keep in contact. No-one's heard anything,' he said.    Ten
 of the infected people - two Australians, one American, three guests 
from Hong Kong, two from Japan and one Filipino crew member - were taken
 ashore by the Japanese coast guard and sent to nearby hospitals on 
Wednesday.   A further ten patients tested positive on Thursday.    More
 than 200 others were anxiously awaiting their test results after they 
were selected for extra screening and medics in hazmat suits went 
deck-to-deck to test for the killer virus.     Passengers were given rations including yoghurt, fruit and bread as well as juice and hot drinks for breakfast this morning   Other
 passengers have shared pictures of their food, including bread rolls 
with cheese and meat and plates of chicken with rice, as staff in face 
masks delivered supplies on board the ship    One cabin aboard the Diamond Princess had a note posted on the door with a request for English Breakfast teabags    Menus
 (above) have been handed out to passengers who are not allowed to leave
 their rooms for up to 14 days. They were told to leave the menu in 
their mailbox for a masked worker to collect it and later deliver the 
food   This image shows a medical form given to passengers on the cruise ship who need more medicines while in quarantine   On
 Wednesday the ship left Yokohama harbour and returned to the open sea 
to collect seawater - which can be converted for use in showers and 
drinking water.          British 
passenger David Abel described how luxury dinners had been replaced with
 rationed food delivered by staff in face masks.     He 
said: 'It's just an extended two-week cruise, but it's not going to be a
 luxury cruise, it's going to be like a floating prison.'    Other
 passengers have shared pictures of their food including bread rolls 
with cheese and meat, plates of chicken with rice, and a chocolate 
dessert - while one cabin had a sign on its door with a request for 
English Breakfast teabags.      It's believed the 
virus was brought onboard by an infected 80-year-old Hong Kong man, who 
joined part of the 14-day cruise, and tested positive for the virus 
after disembarking on January 25.   The virus emerged in the city of Wuhan in China in December and has so far killed 492 people.     Japan's
 health minister Katsunobu Kato said officials would continue to monitor
 the remaining passengers and crew for the potential development of 
symptoms, suggesting that more test samples could be taken.    Until the results are in 'everyone on board... will stay there', he said.    Health workers in protective gear wait for Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers to be transferred to the mainland    Health
 Minister Kato said that officials would continue to monitor the 
remaining passengers and crew for the potential development of symptoms,
 suggesting that more test samples could be taken.    None of 
the 10 infected people, three of whom are Japanese nationals, had severe
 symptoms, public broadcaster NHK reported.     Another 
passenger, a Japanese man in his 70s, told public broadcaster NHK that 
the drastic new quarantine measures had been imposed today after ten 
people tested positive.    'Until yesterday, we were able to 
spend time in common spaces and do things like play ping-pong. But from 
this morning, we have not been allowed to go out of our rooms,' said the
 man.   'I tried to go to a restaurant this morning for breakfast 
but I was told: Please eat in your room. So I have been waiting for room
 service. But it hasn't arrived yet.'      Pictures 
on board the Diamond Princess showed masked health workers in blue 
plastic gowns walking down as well as views of deserted lounges and a 
barren deck.    Cruise operator Princess Cruises said the next 
two trips which were due to depart Yokohama on February 4 and February 
12 had been cancelled.     A spokesman said food and other supplies would be brought on board from other ships when the vessel returns to Yokohama.    'The
 ship plans to go out to sea to perform normal marine operations 
including, but not limited to, the production of fresh water and ballast
 operations before proceeding alongside in Yokohama where food, 
provisions, and other supplies will be brought onboard,' the spokesman 
said.    'Guests will continue to be provided complimentary 
internet and telephone to use in order to stay in contact with their 
family and loved ones, and the ship's crew is working to keep all guests
 comfortable.   'Princess Cruises will continue to fully cooperate 
with and follow the instructions of global medical authorities and the 
Japanese government.'       An ambulance departs the Japan Coast Guard base in Yokohama after bringing virus patients from the Diamond Princess    Ambulance
 workers in protective gears drive an ambulance which is believed to

cases bring the total number of confirmed cases to 33 in Japan. The 
epidemic, which originated in China's Hubei province, has killed 
hundreds of people and infected more than 10,000 so far.    Speaking
 yesterday, passenger Mr Abel claimed that some of his fellow passengers
 'don't give a damn about personal health' and had increased the risk of
 infection with poor hygiene.    In one case, an American 
tourist had blown his nose on a napkin and left it on a dinner table 
where waiters carrying food were likely to touch it, he said.    It is not yet known exactly how the virus spreads.    'Nobody
 is able to book onward flights as we have no idea when the quarantine 
will clear,' said Mr Abel, who is travelling with his wife ahead of 
their 50th wedding anniversary and described himself as a 'captive' on 
the ship.    'The whole ship is in quarantine, we are in the middle of the bay, anchored, so nobody can get on or off this ship.'     The

medical tests on board, Mr Abel said: 'We've had the medical guys come 
into our stateroom and it's taken all night, from midnight to 10am, for 
them to do four of the decks and there are 14 in total.    'They
 came in, took our temperature, asked three questions - have we got a 
cough, have we got a fever, do we take medication to lower 
temperature.'     Despite the large number of people on 
the ship, photos from inside show usually-bustling communal areas are 
all but deserted as those on board are confined to their cabin rooms to 
prevent any possible spread of the virus.    The only people in
 sight are personnel going from room-to-room to test the passengers for 
the virus, or to clean the ship's public areas.    One image

the Wuhan coronavirus   Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga 
said the ship had already been quarantined on Saturday at the port of 
Naha, but the 80-year-old man's diagnosis forced further 
checks.     In addition, any passengers who got off in 
Hong Kong or had close contact with the infected man will be subject to 
tests for coronavirus.     The 80-year-old patient 'did 
not visit a medical centre inside the ship while he was sailing with 
us', according to cruise operator Carnival Japan.    'According
 to the hospital where he is staying, his condition is stable and 
infection was not found among his family members who sailed with him,' 
they said.     Despite the large number of people

 has already barred foreign nationals who have been to Hubei, the 
Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak.     People with passports issued in Hubei are also banned from Japan in a bid to contain the crisis.    Visitors who display symptoms of the new virus when they arrive in Japan can also be denied entry.    A
 total of 11 foreigners have been barred from entering so far, the 
immigration service agency said today.  Japan has also flown 
more than 500 citizens out of Wuhan, where the coronavirus 
originated.     The disease is believed to have emerged in
 a market in Wuhan that sold wild animals, spreading rapidly as people 
travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in late January.    The
 virus has so far spread to more than 20 countries, prompting the World 
Health Organization to declare a global health emergency.    In
 addition, Hong Kong yesterday announced that a 39-year-old coronavirus 
patient had died in hospital - only the second fatality outside mainland
 China.       NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15           "

 in Sydney's Lower North Shore, and Eastwood in the north-west - which 
have large Chinese populations - are bearing the brunt of 
the hysteria surrounding the disease, with some shops reporting 
that trade has slumped more than 70 per cent since the 
outbreak.      Fourteen people have been diagnosed 
with coronavirus in Australia - four in Queensland, four in NSW, four in
 Victoria and two in South Australia.    Worldwide it has killed 490 people worldwide and infected more than 24,000.   Star
 Capital Seafood Restaurant on Chatswood's normally busy Victoria Avenue
 opened seven years ago but owner Michael Lam has decided to close the 
doors for good   Star Capital Seafood Restaurant has been in operation for seven years but is closing on Sunday   At midday on Wednesday there was only one table of five at Star Capital Seafood Restaurant   Chatswood in Sydney's Lower North Shore has become a virtual  ghost town with many residents wearing masks   The only shops that appear to be making money amid the health scare are chemists selling face-masks and hand-sanitiser.   Owners
 of pharmacists and vitamin stores said they were busier than ever 
with some saying the demand for face masks has jumped by 300 per cent.   Michael
 Lam, owner of Star Capital Seafood Restaurant on Chatswood's normally 
busy Victoria Avenue, has shut down his restaurant after seven 
years.    Mr Lam told Daily Mail Australia he made the decision
 following weeks of poor sales as well as the Prime Minister's move to 
ban non-citizens from flying to Australia from China.    'Business
 has become terrible, usually by 11.30am the place is full and now we 
are lucky to get four or five people,' he told Daily Mail 
Australia.    'As soon as the Prime Minister said flights from China were stopping, I decided to close.'     Mr
 Lam said he had already been thinking about retiring, but Mr Morrison's
 announcement prompted him to make the decision earlier.     'This week we have been selling lobsters for $88 per kilogram, but last week they were $130 a kilo,' the business-owner said.    'The locals aren't coming out so we cannot sell, it's very, very bad.'   Universities,
 schools, student accommodation providers, hotels, restaurants, tourist 
operators and airlines have been hit by ban, which may last for longer 
than a fortnight if the outbreak worsens.   Education industry 
officials said the travel ban could cost their industry alone up to $8 
billion in the worst case scenario.    Local councils are pleading with customers to return to the usually bustling centres.    A worker at Tim's Barbeque Chatswood, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that business wasn't very good in the area   Chinese restaurants in Chatswood are practically empty as the suburb has turned into a ghost town   Staff at Chatswood BBQ Kitchen said the situation was dire.   'There has been a big drop in business the last week,' worker Lee said.   'The manager says he wants to cry - there's no business and it's bad...and I've been noticing there's less people around.'   A worker at Tim's Barbeque Chatswood, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that business has taken a hit.    'It's very quiet in the area...business is not as good.'    But pharmacists and vitamin stores are busier than ever.   Lara,
 who works at Mr Vitamins in Chatswood, told Daily Mail Australia they 
remained busy, with sales for cold and flu products booming.   Just a few doors down at Chatswood BBQ Kitchen, staff said it is the same (Manager, Raymond, pictured)   'The
 manager says he wants to cry - there's no business and it's bad...and 
I've been noticing there's less people around,' worker Lee said.   'We've sold heaps of hand-sanitiser but lots of people are after cold and flu vitamins,' she said.   'At our other store we ordered 400 face-masks and sold out instantly, when I last checked there were two left.'    Pharmacists
 and health stores along the street were much the same, as scores of 
people have rushed to get their hands on face masks.     Maria at Shands Compounding Chemist said the pharmacy sold out of face masks before 10.30am.   'We're trying to get them in as much as possible...we have a delivery every day but they sell out in an hour,' Maria said.   'Some people are buying boxes of 50 at a time.'   Maria said the chemist had also sold out of hand-sanitiser and alcohol swabs.   Despite small shop-owners admitting their business has dropped, pharmacists and vitamin stores are busier than ever    Lara,
 who works at Mr Vitamins in Chatswood, told Daily Mail Australia they 
remained busy, with sales for cold and flu products booming   'People are buying three to four boxes of products at a time, it's been busy here - more so than usual,' she said.    Pharmacy
 manager at the chemist, Jerome, said the demand for face masks and 
sanitary products was 'definitely noticeable'.     'There 
is an increase in sales but it's hard to say the percentage...I'd say 
there is a 300 per cent increase in demand for masks,' he 
said.     It is a similar story in Eastwood where some 
shop owners have reported a downturn over more than 70 per cent since 
the coronavirus outbreak.   Manager at Happigo Supermarket, Bobby, 
said the drop in sales was 'very quick' and business has been bad for 
nearly two weeks.    'The Chinese community has become very quiet...there's not many people on the street,' he said.   'People are scared of the coronavirus.'   Maria at Shands Compounding Chemist said the pharmacy sold out of face masks before 10.30am (Worker Clara pictured)   Manager
 at Happigo Supermarket, Bobby, said the drop in sales was 'very quick' 
and business has now been bad for one-and-a-half weeks   Both areas are usually booming with a dense Chinese population, but the only stores that appear to be making money are chemists   A worker at J &amp; T BBQ, who wished to remain anonymous, also said business has been bad for the past three weeks.   Owner
 of Nuzar Spicy Hot Pot, Jason, told Daily Mail Australia he had opened 
his shop just one-and-a-half weeks before the coronavirus outbreak 
occurred.   'The fear is spreading faster than anything...my 
business was here two weeks when it happened and my sales just dropped,'
 Jason said.   'My location is one of the best in the area, which 
comes with the highest rent... I can't even afford to pay my staff at 
the moment.'    Jason said on Sunday he made a profit of only $200, and doesn't think it is going to get any better in the coming weeks.   Ryde councillors are now launching an emergency 'Return to Eastwood' PR campaign to regenerate the area.    Owner
 of Nuzar Spicy Hot Pot, Jason, told Daily Mail Australia he had opened 
his shop just one-and-a-half weeks before the coronavirus outbreak 
occurred   Pharmacists and health stores along the street were much the same, with all of them being sold out of face masks   Of the eight chemists and pharmacies on Victoria Avenue in Chatswood, not a single one sold masks   Mayor
 Jerome Laxale and deputy mayor Simon Zhou have put forward a motion to 
promote local businesses to get owners back on their feet.   The 
'Eastwood Small Business Hardship' motion has called on the general 
manager to set up a $500,000 Small Business Hardship Fund to help 
Eastwood Town Centre.   Part of the money will go towards subsidised gift vouchers to revamp the local economy.   Mr
 Laxale said the main focus of the campaign was to educate people about 
coronavirus in the area to avoid misinformation being spread.   'Eastwood
 has been targeted with false information. The fact is Eastwood is safe 
and we want to educate the public and get the right facts out there,' he
 told the Northern District Times.   'The last three weeks it's been
 a ghost town and it's an incorrect perception of Eastwood. It's not 
good for local businesses and local employees.   'People are staying
 away from Eastwood and there is nothing out there to say Eastwood is 
not safe. I'm calling on the local MP Victor Dominello and the Premier 
to do the same.'   There have been 14 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, and more than 24,000 cases and more than 490 deaths globally.   The cases have occurred in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.     Ryde councillors are now launching an emergency 'Return to Eastwood' PR campaign to regenerate the area     NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15           "

The Malaysian man was waiting to be picked up in  Melbourne  on Wednesday when the driver spotted him standing on the road.       In text messages seen by  The New Daily , the passenger told his driver he was standing outside a carwash.    'Hello? I'm in front of the car wash. You've passed me I think,' he wrote.   'OK, got it!,' the driver replied. 'I don't want to get coronavirus.'    A Melbourne Uber driver refused to collect a passenger, claiming he didn't 'need coronavirus'   The
 shocking exchange comes in the wake of a string of other racist remarks
 Asian people have been subjected to since the outbreak of the virus in 
the Chinese province of Wuhan.    Wai Hoey, a Chinese-Australian, said he and his wife had also been the victims of racism since the outbreak of the coronavirus.   While the couple were standing at a set of traffic lights a man noticed they were there and then took a few steps away.   Mr Hoey said the same thing happened on another occasion when he was using a shopping centre's elevator.    Mr Hoey and his wife were getting off at the same level as two elderly women.   Passengers are seen wearing face masks as they arrive at a station in Hong Kong   But
 he claims that after the women realised they were Chinese, they decided
 to press a lower floor so they could get off separately.   'They obviously did not want to be in the same lift as us,' Mr Hoey said.    'We
 need all rational people to help stop the racist virus from spreading 
and take us back to the racially less tolerant days.'    Another
 man, Lionel Leung, said his friend was forced to wait in her car 
instead of the waiting room at a doctors office - because she was 
wearing a face mask.   To make matters worse, it was a 40C day.    'Because
 she had a mask on and she's Chinese, the girl at the reception said to 
her 'yes, we have your appointment time here. The doctor's not ready as 
yet, can you please wait in your car?'' Mr Leung said.    He said the receptionist told her to put the air-conditioning on and she would be called when the doctor was ready.    A spokesperson for Uber told Daily Mail Australia there were non-discrimination policies set in place.   'We
 have clear non-discrimination policies that are laid out in our 
Community Guidelines, that driver-partners are required to acknowledge,'
 the spokesperson said.   'Last year we also rolled out mandatory 
educative materials to all drivers who use the Uber app in Australia. 
These modules include information on the legal and regulatory 
requirements of rideshare drivers, including those relating to

The
 health body has urged the nation to improve surveillance, case 
detection and preparations at appointed health facilities in case the 
deadly disease comes ashore.   It comes as the south-east Asian 
archipelago, with a population of 270million, has not reported a case, 
creating concerns some may be going undetected.   Popular 
Australian holiday hub Indonesia has come under fire from the World 
Health Organisation for not being prepared enough to handle a 
coronavirus outbreak (Devil's Tear at Nusa Lembongan Bali pictured)   WHO's
 Indonesian representative Dr Navaratnasamy Paranietharan said the 
country had taken 'concrete measures' to defend against potential 
incidents but more could still be done.    He said Indonesia 
had already set up facilities assigned to treat infected patients and 
had begun screening people at international borders but diagnostic 
methods remained weak.     'Indonesia is doing what is possible to be prepared for and defend against the novel coronavirus,' he told the  Sydney Morning Herald .   'There
 is still more work to do in the areas of surveillance and active case 
detection, and the preparation of designated health facilities fully 
with adequate infection prevention and control measures to be able to 
cope with a heavy patient load of any suspected or confirmed cases, in 
the event of an outbreak scenario.'   A number of foreign 
tourists from China walked to the departure lounge of Hang Nadim 
Airport, Batam, Riau Islands, after being summoned home following the 
coronavirus outbreak   'The availability of specific test kits
 to confirm nCoV [novel coronavirus] this week is a significant 
improvement in the right direction.'   Last week, medical 
authorities only had access to a pan-coronavirus test which can identify
 any virus in the corona family, such as the common cold, SARS and MERS,
 but not single one out.    Additional gene sequencing, which 
can take up to five days, is needed to  confirm cases of the novel 
coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, dubbed 2019-nCoV.     Dr
 Paranietharan said WHO were worried that no cases had been identified 
but that authorities had verified that lab testing was functioning 
well.     The call to action comes as Australian expat 
living in Bali who feared he had contracted the coronavirus heavily 
criticised his treatment at local health facilities.   An

Denpasar's Sanglah hospital on January 26 after returning home from a 
trip to Singapore seriously ill.      The Australian 
said he was turned away from another hospital first, who recommended 
Sanglah as they were the only facility that were equipped to test for 
the illness.    But once he arrived, he was continuously shifted between departments.    'No
 staff had masks on or took it seriously. I was asked to fill in forms

said.     An officer inspects a monitor as

 man, who was later diagnosed with pneumonia, said while his experience 
was frustrating, he was more concerned by the lack of official reports,

 (Reuters) - An American became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim 
of the new coronavirus, U.S. officials said on Saturday, and a Japanese 
man also died with symptoms consistent with the disease, as the epidemic
 looked set to pass the death toll from SARS.        The 60-year old
 U.S. citizen died on Feb. 6 in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus 
outbreak in the central Chinese province of Hubei, a U.S. embassy 
spokesman said in Beijing.        aWe offer our sincerest 
condolences to the family on their loss,a the spokesman told Reuters. 
aOut of the respect for the familyas privacy, we have no further 
comment.a        A Japanese man in his sixties and hospitalised with
 pneumonia in Wuhan, also died after suffering symptoms consistent with 
the new coronavirus, Japanas foreign ministry said.        But owing
 to difficulties in diagnosing the disease, the cause of death was given
 as viral pneumonia, the ministry said, citing Chinese medical 
authorities.        As of noon on Thursday, 17 foreigners were being
 treated for the disease in quarantine in China, according to the latest
 government figures.        The death toll in mainland China rose by
 86 to 722 on Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass 
the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe
 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from
 animals to humans in China.        During the SARS outbreak between
 November 2002 and July 2003, the number of reported cases was 8,098, 
suggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest coronavirus, 
but a higher mortality rate.        Two deaths have been reported 
outside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both 
victims were Chinese nationals. A Reuters count based on official 
reports show there are more than 330 cases outside China, in 27 
countries and regions.        aIt is hard to say how lethal this 
novel coronavirus infection is,a Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious 
diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.        aWhile
 the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be 
many people who have been infected that havenat been tested ... We 
probably wonat know the true case fatality for some time yet.a        Most
 of the deaths in China have occurred in and around Wuhan. Hubei 
officials on Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in Wuhan, a 
city in virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, the number of 
outstanding cases stood at 31,774.        News of the death on 
Friday of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for 
raising the alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked sorrow and outrage 
on Chinese social media and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow 
to tell the world about the SARS outbreak.        Beijingas 
communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed
 factories to contain the epidemic, a response that has had ripple 
effects globally for financial markets and businesses dependent on the 
worldas second-biggest economy.        Saturday marked the final day
 of the Lunar New Year holiday, a day usually characterised by family 
gatherings, fireworks, and the lighting of lanterns.        The 
Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday, although many 
workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar workers will 
continue to work from home.        The Shanghai city government said Teslaas (  TSLA.O  )  factory would reopen on Monday.        Apple
 Inc APPL.O said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices 
and call centres next week, and was making preparations to reopen retail
 stores there.            A

warning about the coronavirus outbreak before it was officially 
recognized, is seen after Li died of the virus, at an entrance to the

previously and saying a deeper hit is possible.        aItas 
certainly not going to be a return to normal next week,a said Julian 
Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in 
Singapore.         aThe longer this disruption continues the higher 
the risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger 
hit on the economy,a he said.               Hong
 Kong on Saturday was introducing a two-week quarantine for all people 
arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 
14 days.        While China is bearing the brunt of the virus, 
anxiety levels are spiking across Asia, with Japan alarmed by the rising
 number of cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship, major foreign 
companies pulling out of an international airshow in Singapore, and 
Thailand losing money as Chinese tourists stay home.        Another 
three people on the cruise liner off Japan tested positive for 
coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship 
to 64, Japanas health ministry said.           Thailand reported 
seven new cases, including three Thais and four Chinese, bringing the 
total reported in the country to 32, among the worldas highest number of
 infections outside of China.        Taiwan and Hong Kong urged 
residents not to hoard goods such as toilet paper amid signs of panic 
buying, and the World Health Organization (WHO) chief warned of 
worldwide shortages of medical gowns, masks and other protective 
equipment.            Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (  RCL.N  )

 coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and 
people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to 
reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses 
are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they
 are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The 
coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this 
outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on
 Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed 
around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 
'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named 
after it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr
 Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a 
family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species 
including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild 
animals.    'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there 
were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of 
these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has 
been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and 
result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).    'Coronaviruses
 are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another 
and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new 
coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet 
known.'     The first human cases were publicly reported 
from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people 
live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on 
December 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had 
been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were 
developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The
 first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 
cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 
people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.      Where does the virus come from?    According
 to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from 
bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the 
similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet 
cats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came 
from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which 
has since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market 
is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being
 sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, 
porcupines and camel meat.    A study by the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific 
journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in 
patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found 
in bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so 
scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a 
middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a 
human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr
 Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not 
involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places 
the origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether
 another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, 
and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host 
might have been.'      So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?     Experts
 say the international community is concerned about the virus because so
 little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It
 is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 
in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus 
which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which
 killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for
 COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any 
immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This 
means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across 
often, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in 
January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel 
viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which
 circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most
 seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 
1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand
 fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate 
could be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.    'My
 feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this 
iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The
 illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, 
making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even
 before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the 
saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, 
kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live
 on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning 
people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,
 people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in 
Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been 
there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to 
person.     What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once
 someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 
days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still
 be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, 
typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever 
(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from 
these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an 
infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with 
fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing 
that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the
 virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to 
flu, but it is not clear why.       What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?         Scientists
 in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of 
the virus and released them to experts working around the world.    This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.      Examinations
 have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known 
as mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,
 the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it 
spread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and 
to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus 
might look different every time scientists analyse it.      More
 study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small 
number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were
 various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed 
separately.    How dangerous is the virus?      The
 virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death 
rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 
50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning
 of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are 
infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded 
cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they 
never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more 
serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it 
really is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr
 Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a 
mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only 
showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be 
accurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured?     The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics
 do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral
 drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then 
developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge 
amounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and 
it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this 
outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National 
Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, 
say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about 
coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But 
this may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,
 governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and
 to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People
 who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their 
symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected 
public.   And airports around the world are putting in place 
screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's 
temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot 
those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,
 it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small 
likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?       The
 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by 
the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new 
disease'.    Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside 
of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't 
actually spreading actively around the world.  "

 around the globe are screening passengers amid an outbreak of a new 
strain of coronavirus that began in China (pictured Changi 
International airport in Singapore on January 22, 2020)    The
 school's principal, Donna Shevlin, sent a letter to parents this week 
assuring them that the safety of students was top priority, reports  7 News .    'A
 student who recently returned from China has attended school within the
 medical advice provided by the NSW Health of 14 days self-isolation for
 people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus,' the letter 
read.    'Once aware of this situation, the school immediately 
excluded the student from school for 14 days, with a return date of 10th
 February.'    There is no indication the student in question has shown any symptoms of coronavirus.    There are more than 1150 students attending the school.     Meanwhile, a fifth case of  coronavirus  has been confirmed in Queensland.    A 37-year-old Chinese woman travelling in Queensland has been confirmed as infected with the deadly virus.   The
 woman was travelling with the same tour group as the previously 
confirmed cases and is currently isolated in a stable condition at  Gold Coast  Hospital.   All
 nine members of the tour group are in isolation at Gold Coast 
University Hospital after they arrived to the city on Tigerair flight 
TT566 from Melbourne on January 27.    A fifth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Queensland. A computer artwork of the virus is pictured    A
 44-year-old man, a 42-year-old woman, a 37-year-old man and an 
eight-year-old boy from the group have also contracted the 
illness.      It's the state's fifth confirmed case 
of the virus, while there are four each in NSW and Victoria, and 
two cases in South Australia   Of those, three people have recovered and been released.   More
 than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 
nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in mainland China.   Two Australians on a cruise ship off Japan also contracted coronavirus after being exposed by a previous passenger.   The
 pair were among 10 people including three each from Japan and Hong 
Kong, one from the US and one Filipino crew member who tested positive 
aboard the Diamond Princess.    Two Australians on the 
Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan also contracted coronavirus after
 being exposed by a previous passenger   More than 100 Australians have been evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.   Seventy-two
 people, including infants, were flown on a Qantas flight to Western 
Australia on Monday before they were taken to Christmas Island.   Another
 35 Australians joined an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland before they
 were transferred to another flight to join the others.   The group will be held on Christmas Island for 14 days, provided they aren't diagnosed with the illness.    Dr
 Jeanette Young, the state's Chief Health Officer, on Tuesday urged 
anyone who has returned from mainland China in the past 14 weeks and who
 feels unwell to seek medical help immediately.   'This is for the safety of those individuals,' she said.   'It's
 a very early stage of the development of this outbreak, so we don't 
fully understand what it means to people, so we really want to test 
people very early.'   She said she was concerned federal government 
officials hadn't handed over all of its data relating to passengers who 
had flown from mainland China.   More than 400 people have been assessed for coronavirus since screening started at Brisbane International Airport on Sunday.   Meanwhile,
 a Sunshine Coast doctor is leading a team of medical experts treating 
hundreds of Australians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan to 
Christmas Island on Monday.   Doctor Daniel Holmes is steering the team providing treatment while the group sits out 14 days of quarantine.   Queensland
 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has begged the federal government to
 activate natural disaster relief funding in response to the outbreak.   She
 says the tourism industry is being bled dry by travel bans with the 
Cairns region alone losing $200million in forward bookings, and 
exporters including seafood producers who service  China  losing their entire markets.   Meanwhile,

 former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, sparked the 
quarantine measures after being confirmed as having coronavirus.    'The
 results of the remaining 171 tests [of passengers] came out and 41 
tested positive,' Japan's health minister, Katsunobu Kato, 
said on Friday.    'Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that.'    'In total, out of 273 specimens, 61 tested positive,' he added.    The

among its 3,700 passengers that they are not being kept informed    There are 3,700 people on board the ship of which 223 are Australian passengers and three are Australian crew.    The Diamond Princess is currently under a two week quarantine period.    Of
 those who have been confirmed to have coronavirus on board the ship on 
Friday, three patients are aged between 20 and 40 and the remaining 38 
are between 50 and 80 years of age.    Passengers on the ship have been informed they are required to stay in their rooms for the next two weeks.    Officials
 have handed out thermometers so those on board can self-monitor and 
alert authorities if there temperature rises above the normal 37.5 
degrees.    Passengers have been reportedly finding out about 
the additional cases being diagnosed through the media with one saying 
the news gave them a sense of 'dread'.    A female passenger 
was seen on Friday holding a Japanese flag from one of the ship's 
balconies reading 'medicine shortage' in Japanese.    It is understood the first 20 cases have already been removed from the ship and transported to hospitals in Japan.    Passengers on board the Diamond Princess are seen wearing facemasks as the ship remains docked in port at Yokohama     One of the breakfasts served to passengers in lockdown in their rooms aboard the Diamond Princess    Inside the ship, once bustling common areas are empty and cafe and restaurants shut down.    Food is being delivered to the guests as they remain confined to their rooms.      After
 the first two Australian cases were confirmed aboard the ship on 
Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said the government would 
provide assistance to those on board.    When asked if 
Australians would be quarantined when they returned to the country, Mr 
Dutton said it would be decided on a case by case basis.     'We'll take the advice from the chief medical officer,' he said.   'My
 understanding is if they've been in isolation for 14 days, on that 
boat, and people who have presented with the virus have been removed 
from that setting, then I think they can come back.   'I think we'll
 have a look at the individual cases, and DFAT has done a great job at 
looking at the individual cases and the nuance of each family unit and 
how we can help those people.'    A woman is seen waving

 minister Scott Morrison said Australians are among the 41 new cases on 
Friday on board the ship, but couldn't confirm ABC reports of five 
cases.    Meanwhile, another flight is on its way to evacuate Australians from China.    The
 Qantas plane took off about 12.30pm AEDT on Friday. It will land in 
Hong Kong for a brief stop over before flying on to Wuhan, the Chinese 
city at the centre of the outbreak.   The evacuees will be taken to a
 mining camp near Darwin after the government was told the Christmas 
Island facility currently housing around 270 evacuees could not properly
 segregate the next group.    There have been 28,285 reported 
cases of the virus across the world, mostly in China, with 565 of them 
being deadly, according to official government figures.    The 
Australian government is preparing plans if the outbreak continues as 
the quarantine facility on Christmas Island reaches capacity.    Mr Morrison said defence officials are working to identify mainland sites that could handle any overflow.    The
 advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for travel
 to mainland China is 'level 4 a do not travel'.    There have 
been 15 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Australia: five in Queensland,
 four each in NSW and Victoria, and two in South Australia.    Of these cases five have recovered and the remaining are stable.    Japan

 eight most prominent universities have dismissed media reports that 
they are planing to quarantine international students on regional 
campuses as a result of the  federal governmentas travel ban .   Since 1 February foreign nationals have been  barred from entering Australia within 14 days of leaving China , as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak.   On Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Australian universities were a drawing up plans to quarantine thousands of international students a on regional campuses or in student accommodation to reduce disruption to the start of semester.   The University of Sydneyas campus in Camden, 50km from its main site, was listed as a potential site.   But
 Vicki Thompson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8), told 
Guardian Australia this was not under consideration by its universities.   The
 Go8 comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, ANU, the University of 
Melbourne, Monash, the University of Queensland, the University of 
Adelaide and the University of WA.   A spokeswoman for the University of Sydney said it had ano plans to use our Camden campus for isolation purposesa.   Under
 the current travel restrictions, any student who had left China and had
 been outside the country for 14 days without showing symptoms would not
 need to be further quarantined.   International students  contributed $34bn to the Australian economy  last year, and the sector faces major losses from students cancelling enrolments.   The travel ban has left nearly  100,000 Chinese    students 
 with valid visas stranded outside Australia, according to the latest 
figures from the Department of Home Affairs. Almost 59,000 Chinese 
international students are in Australia.   As of Friday, there had been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus across Australia, of which five people had recovered.   Many
 universities have extended the deadline to enrol for the first 
semester, or to defer studies for a semester, or are offering online 
classes.   On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg,  told Radio National 
 there amight be opportunities for some of the universities to provide 
quarantine for those Chinese students who are coming to Australiaa a but
 did not mention regional campuses.   On Friday, the Go8 said it was implementing other measures to aminimise the disruption to studya.   Thompson
 said where possible semester one programs could ajoin seamlesslya to 
semester two programs, especially for students close to completing their
 degrees.   Monash University  has pushed back the start date of the semester by a week , while more than 4,000 students at the University of Sydney signed a petition to delay theirs by a fortnight.   The
 University of Sydney said it had arranged temporary accommodation for 
the asmall number of students living in student accommodation that need 
to self-isolatea.   Financial analysts Moodyas said on Friday that 
the financial hit of coronavirus and travel restrictions would be 
amanageablea if it was contained within the next few months.   But it noted that Australian universities were more dependent on international students from China than other OECD countries.   Among the Go8, 60% of international student enrolments are from China, and they represent 40% across all universities.   aIf
 coronavirus is quickly contained a meaning within several months a the 
effect on Australian universities is likely to be manageable, with 
revenue deferred (not lost) and no change to credit quality,a Moodyas 
said.   aHowever, if the current outbreak is not contained quickly, 
the revenue effect and drawdown of cash reserves has the potential to be
 significant.a   The co-secretary of the NSW branch of the National 
Tertiary Education Union, Michael Thomson, said academics and teachers 
were worried by universitiesa confusing responses to the ban.   aThere
 is concern that university authorities are not being completely clear 
about what is happening,a he said. aPutting something back two weeks a 
does that mean a 13-week semester becomes an 11-week semester?   aIn a sense the concern is the unknown. Itas almost like policy is being made on the hop.a   On
 Friday, the NSW NTEU and the University of Sydneyas student 
representative council organised a protest against the travel ban.   SRC
 president Liam Donohoe said earlier in the week the travel ban went 
against the advice of the World Health Organisation and led to 
international students alosing out on learning, work, relationships and 
communitiesa to the extent that they amay never returna.  "

Mother
 Xing Lan Ren, who lives in China, wanted to see her 22-year-old son 
Xiao Li in Melbourne before he passed away but her visa was not approved
 in time   After the crash, Ms Ren payed $1,415 to fast track her visa application, which normally takes two working days.    However,
 three days later Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a two-week ban
 on foreign arrivals from mainland China in order to stop the spread of 
coronavirus.   Mrs Ren was shocked by the news and told a local 
Chinese-language publication that she just wanted to say goodbye to her 
only son.     'My family is completely in the dark, and 
now I just want to see the [son] for the last time, but Australia has 
issued a travel ban,' she told  Sydney Today .   'I really don't know what to do.'   Family
 friend Simon Lee started a Change.org petition pleading for Ms Ren and 
her brother Shi Luming to be allowed into the country.    The petition was directed at Federal MP Gladys Liu and garnered almost 3,000 signatures.   'We

Passengers
 were already at Wuhan's airport when the decision was made, leaving 
them stranded in the epicentre of the deadly disease.    They were set to be flown to Darwin - where a second quarantine station has been set up - on Saturday morning.    So
 far, Australia has confirmed 15 cases of the respiratory virus, which 
has killed more than 630 people and infected 30,000 worldwide.    Australian officials have since rescheduled the flight for 3.15am Sydney time on Sunday morning.    Wuhan (pictured) has gone into lockdown since the outbreak began, with many residents isolated and trapped in their homes   Medical staff in Wuhan (pictured) have been overwhelmed by coronavirus patients since the outbreak began   There
 are already 278 Australians in quarantine on Christmas Island, but they
 are running out of beds amid concerns the detention centre is not well 
equipped.    The rescue flight was due to be the latest in a 
series of missions to save stranded citizens from the disease-stricken 
city.     Health Minister Greg Hunt had announced an 
abandoned workersa village near Darwin would become a second coronavirus
 quarantine area.   The $600 million Manigurr-ma accomodation 
village is 30km south of Darwin at Howard Springs, and boasts a 50-seat 
cinema and a swimming pool.   Patients can while away their time in 
the library, or get some exercise at the beach volleyball court, cardio 
and spin room or 2,700 metre running track.   The sprawling site has 875 villas, with 3,500 ensuite bedrooms.    Qantas'
 first coronavirus plane (pictured) arrived on Christmas Island earlier 
this week after rescuing more than 100 Australians from Wuhan   Wuhan
 residents (pictured) are seen queuing for medical supplies at Wuhan Red
 Cross Hospital. Around 600 Australians were in the city at the start of
 the outbreak   The first Qantas 747 jet carrying more than 
100 Australians left Wuhan on February 2, before landing in Western 
Australia on Tuesday.   Those on board were then ushered onto two smaller planes and taken to Christmas Island for 14-day quarantine period.     The flight was operated by a volunteer team of four pilots and 14 Qantas cabin crew.   Qantas
 CEO Alan Joyce said passengers underwent thorough health checks before 
boarding and wore surgical masks, which were changed every hour.   There
 was a limited food and beverage service to minimise interaction between
 crew and passengers and the 747 plane will be thoroughly cleaned 
afterwards.   Qantas staff wear protective face masks to protect themselves (pictured) at Brisbane Airport on January 31    Mr
 Joyce revealed the meals and drinks would be laid out on the seats 
before the flight departed to avoid crew interacting directly with the 
passengers.   'With the passengers, they're going to be given 
protective masks. And they're changed regularly and told how to use 
them,' Mr Joyce told the Today Show.   'On the aircraft, the air is 
actually replaced every five minutes. And the aircraft have these 
medical grade filters and this has 20 on board which remove 99% of all 
particles on the aircraft including viruses. So it's safer than public 
transport.'   Mr Joyce said the risky rescue operations took a 'lot 
of planning' and revealed the Qantas staff who volunteered would stay on
 the upper deck of the jet for the flight.   Symptoms of the virus (pictured) include fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath   China has gone into lockdown after the virus claimed more than 400 lives (pictured, students in Beijing)    Officials
 have sought to reassure those living near the second quarantine station
 in Howard Springs that they will be safe from the virus.   Australiaas
 Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said: 'It is important people 
living in and around Howard Springs know the novel coronavirus can only 
be transmitted by close contact with an infectious person and cannot be 
spread through the air.   'The health and safety of the Howard 
Springs community is of paramount importance and I am confident the 
security and public health measures put in place will prevent any risk 
to the communityas health.'   Australia now has 13 cases of the coronavirus (pictured), including four in New South Wales    Visitors

it was a mistake to say they would.   People who have been in 
mainland China since the start of February - excluding Hong Kong, Macau 
and Taiwan - are now advised to self-isolate.   Australians are also being told not to travel to mainland China.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison announced on February 1 that foreign travellers
 who have left or passed through China will be denied entry to 
Australia.   Australian citizens, permanent residents and their 
immediate families, dependents, legal guardians and spouses, will be 
exempted from the strict measures, Mr Morrison said.   'If you've

 Feb 8 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus epidemic in mainland China is 
almost certain to become more deadly than SARS on Saturday as the death 
toll passed 700, health experts warned of mask shortages and more cases 
were confirmed on a quarantined Japanese cruise ship.   The number 
of new infections in China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the 
outbreak, rose on Friday from a day earlier, Chinese health officials 
said, reversing two days of declines and showing the difficulty of 
predicting the epidemic's peak.   The death toll in mainland China 
jumped by 86 to 722, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded 
globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from animals to humans 
in China.   So far only two deaths have been reported outside 
mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines - from about 332 cases
 in 27 countries and regions.   During the SARS outbreak between 
November 2002 and July 2003, 774 people died globally, while the number 
of reported cases was 8,098, suggesting a far lower transmission rate 
than the latest coronavirus, but a higher mortality rate.   After 
China recorded its first daily drop in the number of new infections on 
Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was too early say 
whether the outbreak had peaked.   The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Hubei capital of Wuhan, where wildlife was sold illegally.   ""It
 is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is - that 
is, what proportion of people with infection will eventually die of the 
infection,"" Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at 
Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.   ""While the crude 
mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people 
who have been infected that haven't been tested ... We probably won't 
know the true case fatality for some time yet.""   Hubei officials on
 Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in Wuhan, a city under 
virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, excluding the 2,050 people who 
had recovered and those who had died, the number of outstanding cases 
stood at 31,774.   Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off 
cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, 
with ripple effects for global markets and businesses dependent on the 
world's second-biggest economy.   WHO experts say they have not seen
 the same rapid increase in cases in provinces outside Hubei, or in the 
Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau that were badly hit by SARS.   Speaking in Geneva, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned earlier that ""the numbers could go up again.""   FALSE NEGATIVES   Not all of the infected will test positive for the virus, warned Wang Chen, head of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.   ""For
 patients who are really infected with the new type of coronavirus, the 
positive rate for tests is 30% to 50%,"" Wang told state television in an
 interview that has gone viral on social media since its telecast on 
Wednesday.   ""There are still many false negatives by collecting 
suspected cases of throat swabs. In other words, more than half of the 
people who are truly infected with the new coronavirus may be 
'negative'.""   Hubei has started to use computerized tomography (CT)
 scans for quicker and more accurate test results. of how China was slow
 to tell the world about the SARS outbreak were rekindled on Friday when
 a doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the new coronavirus 
succumbed to the disease in a Wuhan hospital.   Ophthalmologist Li 
Wenliang, 34, was among eight people reprimanded by police in Wuhan for 
spreading ""illegal and false"" information after he shared details of the
 virus with colleagues. media users called him a hero and shared a 
selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and 
holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message
 ""farewell Li Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank.   There 
were signs that discussion of Li's death was being censored. After 
briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor 
Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no search 
results.   LACK OF MASKS, GOWNS   The WHO chief warned of worldwide shortages of gowns, masks and other protective equipment.   ""When
 supplies are short and demand is high, then there could be bad 
practices like hoarding in order to sell them at higher prices, and 
that's why we ask for solidarity,"" Tedros told a Geneva briefing.   Another
 three people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for 
coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship 
to 64, Japan's health ministry said on Saturday. Caribbean Cruises Ltd 
RCL.N on Friday banned ""any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau
 passport, regardless of when they were there last"" from boarding the 
company's ships.   WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of 
Asians being shunned in the West over a perceived connection to 
coronavirus was ""utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to 
stop.""   Taiwan's government said that starting from Monday it would
 suspend all direct passenger and freight shipping between the island 
and China. It had already decided to suspend most flights from Monday 
between Taiwan to China.   Hundreds of foreigners have been 
evacuated out of Wuhan over the past two weeks. A second evacuation 
plane to airlift Australians out of Wuhan was delayed after China did 
not give it clearance to land, Australian officials said on Saturday.   Global
 equity markets and government debt yields slumped on Friday, as growing
 concerns about the virus' impact on global growth overshadowed a strong
 U.S. jobs report. L8N2A759R   Apple Inc (NASDAQ:) APPL.O , however,
 said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call 
centres next week, and was making preparations to reopen retail stores

coronavirus efforts by the WHO.   The United States has sent nearly 
17.8 tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns and

 epidemic in mainland China is almost certain to become more deadly than
 SARS on Saturday as the death toll passed 700, health experts warned of
 mask shortages and more cases were confirmed on a quarantined Japanese 
cruise ship.
   
 The number of new infections in China's Hubei province, the epicentre 
of the outbreak, rose on Friday from a day earlier, Chinese health 
officials said, reversing two days of declines and showing the 
difficulty of predicting the epidemic's peak.
   
 The death toll in mainland China jumped by 86 to 722, and is poised to 
pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that 
jumped from animals to humans in China.
   
 So far only two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - in 
Hong Kong and the Philippines - from about 332 cases in 27 countries and
 regions.
   
 During the SARS outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003, 774 
people died globally, while the number of reported cases was 8,098, 
suggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest coronavirus, 
but a higher mortality rate.
   
 After China recorded its first daily drop in the number of new 
infections on Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 
too early say whether the outbreak had peaked.
   
 The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Hubei capital of Wuhan, where wildlife was sold illegally.
   
 ""It is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is - 
that is, what proportion of people with infection will eventually die of
 the infection,"" Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at
 Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.
   
 ""While the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to
 be many people who have been infected that haven't been tested ... We 
probably won't know the true case fatality for some time yet.""
   
 Hubei officials on Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in 
Wuhan, a city under virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, excluding 
the 2,050 people who had recovered and those who had died, the number of
 outstanding cases stood at 31,774.
   
 Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights
 and closed factories to contain the epidemic, with ripple effects for 
global markets and businesses dependent on the world's second-biggest 
economy.
   
 WHO experts say they have not seen the same rapid increase in cases in 
provinces outside Hubei, or in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and 
Macau that were badly hit by SARS.
   
 Speaking in Geneva, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned earlier that ""the numbers could go up again.""
   
 FALSE NEGATIVES 
  Not all of the infected will test positive for the virus, warned Wang Chen, head of the  Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences .
   
 ""For patients who are really infected with the new type of coronavirus,
 the positive rate for tests is 30% to 50%,"" Wang told state television 
in an interview that has gone viral on social media since its telecast 
on Wednesday.
   
 ""There are still many false negatives by collecting suspected cases of 
throat swabs. In other words, more than half of the people who are truly
 infected with the new coronavirus may be 'negative'.""
   
 Hubei has started to use computerized tomography (CT) scans for quicker and more accurate test results.
   
 Memories of how China was slow to tell the world about the SARS 
outbreak were rekindled on Friday when a doctor who had tried to raise 
the alarm about the new coronavirus succumbed to the disease in a Wuhan 
hospital.
   
 Ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, 34, was among eight people reprimanded by 
police in Wuhan for spreading ""illegal and false"" information after he 
shared details of the virus with colleagues.
   
 Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying 
on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his 
Chinese identification card. One image showed the message ""farewell Li 
Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank.
   
 There were signs that discussion of Li's death was being censored. 
After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes 
doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no 
search results.
   
 LACK OF MASKS, GOWNS 
  The WHO chief warned of worldwide shortages of gowns, masks and other protective equipment.
   
 ""When supplies are short and demand is high, then there could be bad 
practices like hoarding in order to sell them at higher prices, and 
that's why we ask for solidarity,"" Tedros told a Geneva briefing.
   
 Another three people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for 
coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship 
to 64, Japan's health ministry said on Saturday.
   
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned ""any guests holding a 
Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there
 last"" from boarding the company's ships.
   
 WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of Asians being shunned in 
the West over a perceived connection to coronavirus was ""utterly and 
completely unacceptable and it needs to stop.""
   
 Taiwan's government said that starting from Monday it would suspend all
 direct passenger and freight shipping between the island and China. It 
had already decided to suspend most flights from Monday between Taiwan 
to China.
   
 Hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated out of Wuhan over the past 
two weeks. A second evacuation plane to airlift Australians out of Wuhan
 was delayed after China did not give it clearance to land, Australian 
officials said on Saturday.
   
 Global equity markets and government debt yields slumped on Friday, as 
growing concerns about the virus' impact on global growth overshadowed a
 strong U.S. jobs report.
   
 Apple Inc ,
 however, said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and 
call centres next week, and was making preparations to reopen retail 
stores there.
   
 U.S. Secretary of State  Mike Pompeo 
 on Friday said the United States was prepared to spend up to $100

 Feb 8 (Reuters) - An American became the first confirmed non-Chinese 
victim of the new coronavirus on Saturday while a Japanese man also died
 with symptoms consistent with the disease, as the epidemic looked set 
to pass the death toll from the SARS pandemic.   The 60-year old 
U.S. citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at Jinyintan Hospital in 
China's Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, on Feb. 6, a U.S. 
embassy spokesman in Beijing said.   ""We offer our sincerest 
condolences to the family on their loss,"" the spokesman told Reuters. 
""Out of the respect for the family's privacy, we have no further 
comment.""   A Japanese man in his sixties and hospitalised with 
pneumonia in Wuhan, in central Hubei province, also died after suffering
 symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus, Japan's foreign ministry 
said.   But owing to difficulties in diagnosing the disease, the 
cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, the ministry said citing 
Chinese medical authorities.   As of noon on Thursday, 17 foreigners
 were being quarantined and treated for the disease in China, according 
to the latest government figures.   The death toll in mainland China
 rose by 86 to 722 on Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised 
to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic 
of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that 
jumped from animals to humans in China.   During the SARS outbreak 
between November 2002 and July 2003, the number of reported cases was 
8,098, suggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest 
coronavirus, but a higher mortality rate.   Two deaths have been 
reported outside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines - 
from more than 330 cases in 27 countries and regions. Both of those 
victims were Chinese nationals.   ""It is hard to say how lethal this
 novel coronavirus infection is,"" Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious 
diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.   ""While
 the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be 
many people who have been infected that haven't been tested ... We 
probably won't know the true case fatality for some time yet.""   Most
 of the deaths in China have occurred in and around Wuhan. Hubei 
officials on Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in Wuhan, a 
city in virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, the number of 
outstanding cases stood at 31,774.   Beijing's communist leadership 
has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain
 the epidemic, with ripple effects for global markets and businesses 
dependent on the world's second-biggest economy.   Saturday marked 
the final day of the Lunar New Year celebrations, usually characterised 
by family gatherings, fireworks, riddle-guessing and the lighting of 
lanterns.   This year, most people were eating dumplings, a 
traditional custom, at home alone. On national television a gala show 
will feature recitation of poems on counter-virus efforts instead of the
 usual music and dancing.   News of the death on Friday of Li 
Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the alarm 
about the new coronavirus, sparked sorrow and outrage on Chinese social 
media and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world 
about the SARS outbreak.   PANIC BUYING   Hong Kong on Saturday 
was introducing a two-week quarantine for all people arriving from the 
mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days.   Matthew
 Cheung, chief secretary for administration, said Hong Kong people 
returning from the mainland must stay home for a fortnight or risk a 
fine or jail.   Non-Hong Kong residents must stay in government isolation centres or hotel rooms for the same period, facing the same penalties.   While
 China is bearing the brunt, anxiety levels are spiking across Asia, 
with Japan alarmed by the rising number of cases aboard a quarantined 
cruise ship, major foreign companies pulling out of an international 
airshow in Singapore, and Thailand losing money as Chinese tourists stay
 home.   Another three people on the cruise liner off Japan tested 
positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases 
from the ship to 64, Japan's health ministry said.   Thailand 
reported seven new cases, including three Thais and four Chinese, 
bringing the total reported in the country to 32, among the world's 
highest number of infections outside of China.   Taiwan and Hong 
Kong urged residents not to hoard goods such as toilet paper amid signs 
of panic buying, and the World Health Organization (WHO) chief warned of
 worldwide shortages of medical gowns, masks and other protective 
equipment.   Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned ""any 
guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of

Victorian man Michael Ryan saw the sign outside the Albury store on Saturday before uploading it to Twitter.    The
 photo received disapproving comments from outraged social media users 
who condemned the multinational chain for trying to capitalise on the 
crisis.    A sign placed out the front of the Harvey Norman store in Albury has caused a furore online   'Fixed
 it for you: ""No coronaviruses in any mattresses but we'll shamelessly 
exploit misinformation for commercial gain"". FFS!' one man wrote.   'This is disgusting! Would definitely NOT buy from any store advertising this way,' some else added.   Another comment read: 'No money for Harvey Norman. No money for racists.'   'The store had Better throw out all the other made in China products then,' a fourth person quipped.     The
 furniture, bedding, and electrical goods company commented on Mr Ryan's
 post asking which store was responsible, before reporting back an hour 
later that the franchisee had removed the sign.   In a later statement, Harvey Norman said the store operator acted alone and apologised for the incident.   'Albury
 franchisee acted in isolation without any consultation or communication
 beyond their store,' a Harvey Norman spokesperson said on Twitter.   'As
 soon as the company was made aware, the sign was immediately removed 
and the franchisee told this was unacceptable. Our 
apologies.'    People wearing surgical masks in central 
district of Hong Kong as a preventative measure following the 
Coronavirus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan   But many people felt the Australian-owned enterprise's apology was not enough.   'Well done. Did Albury store owner also apologize?' a woman asked.    'Surely there is something in the franchise's contract to prevent this from happening,' one man wrote.   Another
 added: 'But youall stop short at disciplinary action, because the dirty
 secret is that while youare aware of the bad PR and optics of that 
sign, thereas not a zero tolerance culture towards it within Harvey 
Norman.'   As of Saturday, 724 people have died and there are 
currently 34,878 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, 
dubbed 2019-nCoV, that began in Wuhan in December.   Last week,

 80-year-old man who disembarked from the cruise in Hong Kong was 
diagnosed with the virus, putting the health of all passengers who were 
on the ship with him at risk.    Since Wednesday, the number of
 passengers confirmed infected has jumped to 64, as the remaining 3,700 
passengers huddle in their quarters and wait to see if symptoms of the 
deadly virus appear.    Dave Binskin and his wife Jan, from 
Palm Beach, on the Gold Coast, were confined to their cabin for three 
days before they started to struggle with boredom.    The 
enterprising couple decided to get in touch their wine club on Friday, 
who offered to deliver them some booze by drone.    Mr Binskin uploaded another picture of on his bed enjoying his wine with the caption 'happy hour drone wine, going troppo'    Writing
 on Facebook Mr Binskin said: 'On a lighter note in the middle of the 
Kaos yesterday we get a ring from our wine club I asked if they do free 
freight to Japan we have arranged for two cases to be delivered by

shared a photo of a bottle pinot noir  and two wine glasses on his 
dresser.    He said the Japanese guard was confused when he spotted the drone but did nothing to stop the delivery.   Mr
 Binskin uploaded another picture of on his bed enjoying his wine with 
the caption 'happy hour drone wine, going troppo'.    After successfully receiving his order, he joked asking for some knitting needles for his wife.    Mr and Mrs Binskin look over the moon after receiving two cases of booze to their cabin via drone   Dave Binskin and his wife Jan contacted his wine club and ordered some drinks while he's quarantined on a cruise ship    The pair are expected to remain on the ship (pictured stock) for another 11 days with more than 3,000 passengers   Despite the situation, Mr Binskin thanked the captain and the crew for their 'fabulous job in a very difficult situation'.   The
 pair are expected to remain on the ship for another 11. There are 
currently 15 cases of coronavirus identified in Australia.    Japanese
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Thursday that Japan will deny entry
 of foreign passengers on another cruise ship heading to Japan - Holland
 America's cruise ship Westerdam, on its way to Okinawa from Hong Kong -
 because of suspected coronavirus patients found on the ship.   The 
new immigration policy takes effect Friday to ensure border control to 
prevent the disease from entering and spreading further into Japan, Abe 
said.   David and Judy Holst, from South Australia, are aboard a 
Holland America vessel currently circling around in the ocean east of 
Taiwan.    As Japanese officials loaded the Diamond Princess 
with supplies to make the quarantine as bearable as possible, passengers
 took to social media to highlight kindnesses by the crew and to 
complain about dwindling medicine, the quality of the food and the 
inability to exercise or even leave their cabins.

letter Kelly had written in 1879 before he robbed the bank in 
Jerilderie, southern New South Wales. You can Google it these days. 
Please do. I hope you see what I saw: Ned Kelly is on fire . a In
 or about the spring of 1870 the ground was very soft a hawker named Mr 
Gould got his wagon bogged between Greta and my motheras house on the 
eleven mile creek, the ground was that rotten it would bog a duck in 
places.a   Why had no one told me about this? Had no one else seen what I saw, 
that the famous bushranger was an avant-garde artist with hardly a comma
 to his name?   I was still drunk on Joyce, and mad with ignorant ambition. I had 
read not very much. I had written one unpublished story but was not shy 
to think that I might write a novel that would transform everyoneas idea
 of that bearded Australian bushranger. aI dare not strike him,a Kelly 
had written about Constable Hall, aor my sureties would loose the bond 
money I used to trip him and let him take a mouth full of dust now and 
again as he was as helpless as a big guano after leaving a dead bullock 
or a horse. I threw big cowardly Hall on his belly I straddled him and 
rooted both spurs onto his thighs he roared like a big calf attacked by 
dogs and shifted several yards of the fence I got his hands at the back 
of his neck and trid to make him let the revolver.a   I did not fix the spelling. I did not add a comma. I transcribed the 
letter and carried it on my person like a holy cross. And yet my first 
novel shows none of Kellyas influence. Samuel Beckett took his place. 
When I lost the Jerilderie letter in a pub I did not bother to replace 
it.   It was over, so it seemed. I published nine novels without a nod to 
Kelly. I became old. I left Australia. I arrived in New York and then, 
just when my friends all feared I had left my country far behind, I 
wandered into the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and there they were: 
Nolanas magnificent Kelly paintings looking very good indeed. One by 
one, I brought my new Manhattan friends uptown and walked them around 
the 27 paintings as if they were the stations of the cross. I explained 
why, while we had no Thomas Jefferson, our imaginary founding father was
 a convicted murderer named Ned Kelly.   This was in 1994, exactly 30 years since I first read the Jerilderie 
letter. At 56, I sat down and wrote what my younger self could not have 
managed: aI lost my own father at 12 yr. of age and know what it is to 
be raised on lies and silences my dear daughter you are presently too 
young to understand a word I write but this history is for you and will 
contain no single lie may I burn in Hell if I speak false .a    My thanks to all my publishers who did not try to add a single comma.     aC/  True History of the Kelly Gang is being reissued by Faber.   "

 Feb 8 (Reuters) - A 60-year-old American has died of the new 
coronavirus, the first confirmed non-Chinese death of the illness, U.S. 
officials said, as millions of Chinese began returning home after a 
Lunar New Year break that was extended to try to contain the outbreak.   While
 the vast majority of cases have been in China, the virus has spread to 
some two dozen countries abroad, with the latest such cases including 
five British nationals infected in a French ski resort.   The 
American man died on Thursday in Wuhan, epicentre of the virus outbreak 
in the central Chinese province of Hubei, a U.S. embassy spokesman said 
in Beijing on Saturday.   ""We offer our sincerest condolences to the
 family on their loss,"" he told Reuters. ""Out of the respect for the 
family's privacy, we have no further comment.""   A Japanese man in 
his sixties and hospitalised with pneumonia in Wuhan also died after 
suffering symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus, Japan's foreign 
ministry said.   The death toll in mainland China rose to 722 on 
Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths
 recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).   Most of the deaths in China have 
occurred in and around Wuhan. Across mainland China, the number of cases
 stood at 31,774 as of Saturday.   The virus has spread to 27 
countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official 
reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported 
outside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both 
victims were Chinese nationals.   The latest patients include five 
British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski resort in 
Haute-Savoie in southeastern France, health officials said, raising 
fears of further infections as British families head for the Alps during
 the school half-term holidays.   The five had stayed in the same 
ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore. They were not in a 
serious condition, the officials said.   The Chinese economy will 
sputter towards normal on Monday, as millions return from the provinces 
to the big cities after the biggest holiday of the year. The holiday was
 extended, but many workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar 
workers will continue to work from home.   U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's factory in Shanghai will resume production on Monday, a government official said on Saturday.   Apple
 Inc said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call 
centres and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. But 
Chinese authorities have blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn to 
resume production from Feb. 10 over concerns about the spread of the 
virus, Japans Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday.   The 
virus has been a blow to China's already-slowing economy, with Goldman 
Sachs cutting its first-quarter GDP growth target to 4% from 5.6% 
previously and saying a deeper hit is possible.   ""It's certainly 
not going to be a return to normal next week,"" said Julian 
Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in 
Singapore.   ""The longer this disruption continues the higher the 
risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit 
on the economy,"" he said.   'HARD TO SAY HOW LETHAL'   Health officials are still uncertain how deadly the illness is.   ""It
 is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is,"" 
Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash 
University in Melbourne, told Reuters.   ""While the crude mortality 
appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people who have 
been infected that haven't been tested ... We probably won't know the 
true case fatality for some time yet.""   News of the death on Friday
 of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the 
alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked outrage on Chinese social media
 and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world about 
the SARS outbreak.   Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off 
cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, a
 response that has had ripple effects globally for financial markets and
 businesses dependent on the world's second-biggest economy.   Chinese-ruled
 Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people 
arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 
14 days.   While China is bearing the brunt of the virus, anxiety is
 increasing across Asia, with Japan alarmed by the rising number of 
cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship, major foreign companies pulling 
out of an international air show in Singapore, and Thailand losing money
 as Chinese tourists stay home.   Another three people on the cruise
 liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total 
number of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan's health ministry 
said.   Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned ""any guests 
holding Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of when they 
were there last"" from boarding the company's ships.   The World 
Health Organization warned on Friday warned against the ""unnecessary, 
unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity"".   (Reporting

'We
 continue to work constructively with Chinese authorities, and 
everything is on track for the flight later tonight,' Foreign Minister 
Marise Payne said in a statement on Saturday night.    More than 250 people are understood to be on the flight.    More
 Australians from the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan in China are primed
 to enter quarantine at an old mining camp north of Darwin. Flight 
boarding in Wuhan   A flight aimed at evacuating the 
Australian citizens and permanent residents from Wuhan has left China 
and will land in Darwin by 11.30am local time   The 
Australians will be sent to the Manigurr-ma Village at Howard Springs, 
an old mining camp about 30km from Darwin, for a 14-day quarantine.   Evacuees
 were screened before they got on the flight, will be monitored 
rigorously on the plane and checked out again once they arrive in 
Darwin.   Anyone suspected to have coronavirus will be taken to hospital and quarantined.     Professor
 Brendan Murphy, Australian Government Chief Medical Officer, said 
people staying at the facility were unlikely to become infectious.   When
 the Australians are extracted they will be sent to the Manigurr-ma 
Village at Howard Springs, an old mining camp about 30km from Darwin. 
Pictured: Image of living facility uploaded by workers when the 
site was a mining camp   'It is important people living in and
 around Howard Springs know the novel coronavirus can only be 
transmitted by close contact with an infectious person and cannot be 
spread through the air,' Professor Murphy said in a statement.   'The
 health and safety of the Howard Springs community is of paramount 
importance and I am confident the security and public health measures 
put in place will prevent any risk to the community's health.'   Christmas Island was unable to house another couple of hundred evacuees.   So
 far two groups of Australian citizens or permanent residents have been 
evacuated to Christmas Island, with 241 leaving on a Qantas flight and 
35 departing on a later Air New Zealand flight.   They all face a two-week quarantine process.    Evacuees
 were screened before they got on the flight, will be monitored 
rigorously on the plane and checked out again once they arrive in 
Darwin. Pictured: Image of living facility uploaded by workers when the

 the old mining facility as Christmas Island does not have the capacity 
for more people. Pictured: Image of living facility uploaded by 
workers when the site was a mining camp   Deputy Chief Medical
 Officer Paul Kelly revealed on Saturday that one of the evacuees - a 
young Australian girl - had been tested for the virus after developing 
an illness.   But her sickness isn't serious and could be 'all sorts of things', he said.   'That person is well, it is certainly not a serious illness at this stage,' he told reporters.   Authorities
 have also just become aware of a third cruise ship, located somewhere 
between Japan and Guam, affected by coronavirus.   Professor Kelly said it wasn't known yet whether there are any Australians on board.   The Diamond Princess cruise ship at Yokohama, Japan, has 3,700 people on board - including 219 Australians who are well.   Two groups of Australian citizens or permanent residents have been evacuated to Christmas Island (pictured)   More
 than 300 people are on Christmas Island. Pictured: Australian evacuees

 has so far had 15 confirmed coronavirus cases: five in Queensland, four
 each in NSW and Victoria and two in South Australia.   Five of the cases have recovered while the ten others are in a stable condition.    All
 of the cases in Australia have come from Wuhan, the virus' epicentre,

 The new     epidemic in mainland     is almost certain tobecome more deadly than SARS on Saturday as the toll passed 700,     experts warned of mask shortages and more cases were confirmed on a quarantined Japanese cruise ship. 
   
The toll in mainland China jumped by 86 to 722, and is poised to pass 
the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe
 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from
 animals to humans in China.
   
Meanwhile, the US Embassy in     says a 60-year-old American citizen diagnosed with the new virus died in    , apparently the first American fatality of the outbreak.
   The number of new infections in China's Hubei province, the epicentre
 of the outbreak, rose on Friday from a day earlier, Chinese health 
officials said, reversing two days of declines and showing thedifficulty
 of predicting the epidemic's peak.
   
So far only two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - in     and the Philippines - from about 332 cases in 27 countries and regions.
   
After China recorded its first daily drop in the number of new 
infections on Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 
too early say whether the outbreak had peaked.
   
The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Hubei
 capital of Wuhan, where wildlife was sold illegally. ""It is hard to say
 how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is - that is, what 
proportion of people with infection will eventually die of the 
infection,"" Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at 
Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.
   
Hubei officials on Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in 
Wuhan, a city under virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, excluding 
the 2,050 people who had recovered and those who had died, the number of
 outstanding cases stood at 31,774.
   
 Three more test positive for virus on cruise ship   
 Another three people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for
 coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship
 to 64, Japan's health ministry said on Saturday. 
   
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said the     was prepared to spend up to$100 million to assist China and support coronavirus efforts by the WHO. 
   
The WHO said out of $675 million it is seeking for its coronavirus 
response through April, it has received pledges of $110 million, $100 
million of that from the Gates Foundation.
   
 Naming the virus   
 The UN health agencyas official temporary name for the disease, 
which it has designated as aglobal health emergency, is a2019-nCoV acute
 respiratory diseasea.

 coronavirus death toll rose to 811 people on Sunday, passing the number
 of global fatalities in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. The number of 
confirmed cases has risen to more than 37,000, but experts hope the 
spread might be slowing.              Latest developments:     China's
 coronavirus death toll rose to 811 people on Sunday, passing the number
 of global fatalities in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic a but fewer 
new cases were reported in a possible sign its spread might be slowing 
as other nations step up efforts to block the disease.   Also
 Sunday, South Korea reported a new case in a 73-year-old woman whose 
relatives visited Guangdong province in southern China. That raised 
South Korea's total to 25.   In China, some 2,656 new virus cases 
were reported in the 24 hours ending at midnight Saturday local 
time, most of them in the central province of Hubei, where the 
first patients fell sick in December. That was down by about 20 per 
cent from the 3,399 new cases reported in the previous 24-hour 
period.   Outside China and Hong Kong, 288 confirmed cases have 
been reported in 24 countries, according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO).    There have been seven cases confirmed in Canada a three in Ontario and four in British Columbia, according to the  Public Health Agency of Canada .     More
 than 200 Canadians who were airlifted from Wuhan a the city at the 
centre of the outbreak in China a are under a 14-day quarantine at a
 Canadian Forces base in Trenton, Ont., as they are monitored for 
symptoms.    Experts say the declining daily toll of new 
cases suggests the virus's spread might be slowing. They say, however, 
the total will rise further once Chinese laboratories test a backlog of 
thousands of samples from possible cases.   ""Dramatic reductions"" 
in the spread of the virus within China should begin to appear toward 
the end of the month if containment measures prove effective, said Dr. 
Ian Lipkin, director of Columbia University's Centre for Infection and 
Immunity, who assisted the WHO and China during the SARS outbreak.   Warmer
 weather will also reduce the ability of the virus to spread and bring 
people out of enclosed spaces where they are more likely to become ill, 
Lipkin said.               However, if there is a
 spike in new cases as people begin returning to work in coming days, 
then ""we'll know we're in trouble,"" Lipkin told reporters in an online 
news conference late Saturday from his U.S. home, where he is under 
14-day self-quarantine.   The death toll passed the 774 
people believed to have died of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome), another viral outbreak that also originated in China. Among 
those who died were 44 people in Canada.    The total of 37,198 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus vastly exceeds the 8,098 sickened by SARS.   Meanwhile,
 a charter flight carrying Filipinos from Wuhan arrived in the 
Philippines. The 29 adults and one infant will be quarantined for 14 
days, the virus's incubation period.     Watch: Montreal woman describes life in Wuhan          Felicity
 Feng, a Montreal woman visiting her parents in Wuhan over the Lunar New
 Year holiday, was caught up in the coronavirus outbreak. 5:09      Elsewhere,
 France closed two schools and tried to reassure vacationers in the Alps
 after five Britons contracted the virus at a ski resort.   France
 stepped up a travel alert, recommending against all visits to China 
except for ""imperative reasons."" Italy recommended students returning 
from China stay home from school for two weeks after the government 
reported three cases.   On Saturday, the U.S. State Department 
said two more flights from Wuhan with American citizens, permanent 
residents and close relatives landed in the United States. A 
spokesperson said more than 800 American diplomats and others have 
been evacuated from Wuhan.   Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO 
director-general, said the organization will send experts to China 
starting Monday or Tuesday.   The American Embassy in Beijing said
 Saturday a 60-year-old U.S. citizen was among the new fatalities in 
Wuhan, the first American death reported in the outbreak. A Japanese 
citizen being treated in Wuhan who was a suspected case also died.   Elsewhere
 in China, the industrial metropolis of Chongqing in the southwest told 
residential communities to close their gates and check visitors for 
fever. The government said the spread of the virus through ""family 
gatherings"" had been reported in Chongqing but gave no details.   Japan
 on Saturday reported three more cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship 
for a total of 64 . There are 3,700 passengers and crew on the Diamond 
Princess who must remain on board for 14 days. As of Friday, seven 
Canadians on the ship had tested positive for coronavirus and been 
taken off the vessel for medical care.        Watch: Tour of Canadian's room aboard quarantined cruise ship          Spencer Fehrenbacher from Langley, B.C., has been under quarantine aboard the ship since Feb. 3 0:38      Prime
 Minister Shinzo Abe said foreign passengers on another ship, Holland 
America's Westerdam, won't be allowed into Japan because of suspected 
cases on board. The ship, with more than 2,000 people, was near Okinawa 
and was looking for another port.   Airlines and tourism 
industries have been battered by the loss of Chinese tourists after 
Beijing cancelled group tours in an attempt to contain the disease.   Hong
 Kong began enforcing a 14-day quarantine for arrivals from mainland 
China. The territory's chief executive, Carrie Lam, has refused demands 
by some hospital workers and others to seal the border completely.   China's
 leaders are trying to keep food flowing to crowded cities despite 
anti-disease controls and to quell fears of possible shortages and price
 spikes following panic buying after most access to Wuhan and nearby 
cities was cut off.   Local authorities have been ordered to speed
 up food shipments. Informal roadblocks set up by some villages to block
 outsiders and possible infection were banned.   Public anger 
simmered over the treatment of a doctor in Wuhan who was reprimanded for
 warning about the virus in December. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist 
died of the disease on Friday.   Li Wenliang became the face of 
anger at the ruling Communist Party's controls over information and 
complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, chemical 
spills and other dangers.   Users of the Sina Weibo microblog 
service have left hundreds of thousands of messages mourning Li's death 
and criticizing official treatment of him and other whistleblowers.   While
 the new virus's mortality rate is lower than previous pathogens, it 
may return after the current outbreak is over, Lipkin said.   ""I
 think this one may [come back], and this is an argument that people are
 using to make for continuing to invest in vaccines and I think it is a 
reasonable argument,"" he said.   Of the extreme measures taken, Lipkin said there was little choice given limited resources and knowledge about the virus.   ""It's
 sort of like the Titanic going down. You only got a certain number of 
lifeboats. You have to make some kind of a decision based on what's best
 for the country as a whole and for the world.""     "

Bushfires have always been a reality in Australia, but never recorded
 on this scale with such widespread damage. Itas estimated that more 
than 60,000 sq km have been scorched in  New South Wales 
 and Victoria alone. Days of smoke have shrouded Sydney, Canberra and 
Melbourne. And after the fires, flooding at the weekend in NSW and parts
 of Queensland left thousands without power and dozens of schools closed
 on Monday.   While the country is still grappling with the economic reality and 
human devastation caused by the fires, itas easy to think the worst of 
this disaster is over. But unfortunately other extreme weather may yet 
occur this summer and these will also require safety preparations and 
rapid responses.   Last year was the driest and hottest year on record in Australia. 
Some parts of the country have had several years of drought in a row. 
But all droughts end eventually. At the weekend devastating storms swept
 through eastern NSW, causing flooding, power outages and commuter 
chaos. The Bureau of Meteorology says 391.6mm of rain fell over Sydney 
in the past four days, the most since 414.2mm fell from 2 to 5 February 
1990.   Historically Australian continental-scale droughts are often broken 
by widespread heavy rain, leading to an increased risk of flooding, 
including potentially lethal flash floods. The flood risk from the heavy
 rains is exacerbated by the bare soil and lack of vegetation caused by 
the drought and by bushfires that destroy forest and grassland. When a 
decade-long drought ended in 2009, what followed were two extremely wet 
years with serious flooding. Flooding also brings the risk that ash 
might contaminate water supplies. The heavy rain falling on bare soil 
can also lead to serious erosion.   The onset of the tropical wet season over northern Australia has been
 very much delayed, as predicted in the middle of last year by the 
Bureau of Meteorology. Most of the Australian tropics have had well 
below average rainfall in the past few months, and some areas had their 
lowest November-January rainfall. As well, the tropical cyclone season 
was late, also predicted by the bureau months ago. In recent weeks there
 has been some cyclone activity and some rain. But the wait is still on 
for widespread tropical rains and for more cyclones to cross the coast 
as Damien did at the weekend. Although rain brought by cyclones are 
often welcome, these systems can also leave serious damage.   We are at the riskiest time for heatwaves in southern Australia. The 
risk usually peaks around the middle to the end of summer. Weather 
conducive to increased bushfire risk also usually peaks in February for 
southern states. So although media, community and political attention 
have focused on the horrendous bushfires we have already suffered, we 
should not overlook the likelihood of other extreme weather, including 
cyclones, floods and heatwaves, or think that the bushfire risk is over 
for the year. It is important to remain vigilant for all weather 
extremes.   Although the fires have tragically claimed many lives, many others 
have been saved by the improved firefighting and warning systems, 
supported by improved weather and climate forecast systems to emergency 
services and the media by the Bureau of Meteorology.   Temperature forecasts five days ahead are better than one-day-ahead 
forecasts were 50 years ago. Rainfall forecasts have also improved 
dramatically. As well, scientific seasonal climate forecasts of rain, 
drought and seasonal cyclones a something not even dreamed of 50 years 
ago a are provided routinely by the bureau. These longer forecasts 
allowed emergency services to better prepare for this horrible summer, 
and the detailed shorter-range forecasts of weather conducive to fire 
spread has helped fire agencies target warnings and provide resources to
 threatened areas.   But one challenge as the summer continues will be the need for 
continued communication between forecasters, emergency services and the 
public about predicted extreme weather. For some, awarning fatiguea may 
set in and announcements of dangerous heatwaves or floods might be 
ignored. The warnings must continue to be disseminated to at-risk 
populations and local authorities must strive to ensure they are acted 
on. And meteorologists must keep up their efforts to improve forecasts 
on all timescales.   Global warming is already lengthening the fire season and making 
heatwaves more intense, more frequent, and longer. It is also increasing
 the likelihood of heavy rains and flash floods while simultaneously 
making droughts worse in some areas. The occurrence of devastating 
bushfires has been increasing in the past few decades, despite better 
forecasts and improved firefighting technology and organisation. The 
intrinsic link between these weather extremes and climate change means 
we need to address the wider issue: what can we do to slow the rate of 
global warming.   Australians pride themselves on winning against the odds and adapting
 to extreme weather. How often have you heard a politician say Australia
 has always been a land of droughts and flooding rains, or that we have 
always had heatwaves and bushfires? Australian rainfall is indeed more 
variable than most parts of the world, so the reality is that we do face
 extreme weather, year after year.   But another reality is that daytime temperatures across Australia 
have increased by more than a degree just in the past 25 years. In the 
1990s on average about 5% of the country each year had annual average 
daytime temperatures in the hottest 10% of historical temperatures. But 
over the past five years, on average, more than  half  the 
country has experienced such hot temperatures each year. From 5% to over

not just all the weather extremes a droughts, floods, heatwaves, 
bushfires, cyclones and storms a but also their impacts on humans, 
animals and the bush.   And there is no reason to expect this warming to slow without 
concerted political action. So we need an increased focus on how to deal
 with these amplified risks from climate and weather extremes a how to 
adapt a at the same time that our politicians lead global action to slow

 the Marvel version of Indonesian and Australian relations, the nations 
are superheroes fighting against intolerance, protectionism and climate 
change.   That's the vision of Indonesian president Joko Widodo, 
who on Monday addressed federal parliament while on a visit to sign a 
historic trade deal with Australia.   ""The collaboration of the 
Indonesian-Australia partnership, in the midst of the rising global 
uncertainties, can be illustrated by the movie 'Avengers: Endgame',"" he 
told the packed chamber.   ""When the forces of good unite, the Avengers assemble and the common enemy can be defeated.   ""When
 Indonesia and Australia continue to collaborate and work together, then
 intolerance and protectionism and the fear of poverty and the threat of
 climate change can be overcome.""   Mr Widodo addressed a gathering
 of members and senators in parliament, an honour also granted to his 
predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2010.   The president earned chuckles for dropping a favourite Australian colloquialism at the start of his speech: ""G'day mate"".   Mr
 Widodo also used his address to call for greater ties between 
Indonesian and Australia youth, who he praised as the ""leaders of 
tomorrow"".   Labor leader Anthony Albanese presented Mr Widodo with
 a colourful mosaic bowl from bushfire-ravaged Mogo on the NSW south 
coast.   Mr Albanese said the gift was to remind Mr Widodo of his 
nation's support to communities struggling after bushfires, with 
Indonesian military, engineers and medical staff helping with relief 
efforts.   The trade agreement, passed by the Indonesian parliament last week, is aimed at boosting multi-billion dollar ties.   Australia will open Indonesia's first foreign university campus and consider watering down its travel warnings.   But Prime Minister Scott Morrison says challenges around terrorism, foreign fighters and influence are still front of mind.   Mr
 Morrison announced Monash University would set up Indonesia's first 
foreign campus - a move he described as ""a very good example of how this
 is a two-way street"".   The deal was made possible after the 
Indonesian government finalised regulations allowing foreign 
universities as part of a push to improve the country's higher education
 performance.   Mr Morrison also detailed plans to make travel easier between the countries.   Australia's travel advisory level for Indonesia is at level two: ""exercise a high degree of caution"".   Indonesia is one of the world's fastest growing economies.   Trade
 Minister Simon Birmingham said the agreement would be a major boost for
 Australian farmers through lower tariffs and improved access.   Indonesian
 goods will be subject to zero tariffs when entering Australia, while 
tariffs on 94 per cent of Australian goods imported to Indonesia will be
 eliminated gradually.   Indonesia and Australia already enjoy bilateral trade worth $17.8 billion.     Advertisement    "

Australiaas Parliament on Monday, urging a closer partnership between 
their nations as their shared democratic values are threatened by 
uncertain global economics.   President Joko Widodo was addressing a rare joint-sitting of the 
Australian Parliament during the first visit to the country by 
Indonesian leader since Susilo Bambang Yuhhoyono in 2010.   Indonesian and Australian officials had earlier signed documents 
supporting bilateral free trade that deepens wide-ranging links between 
the near-neighbors, as the Australian government attempts to reduce its 
heavy economic reliance on China.   Widodo said his country of 270 million people was forecast to become 
the worlda s fourth-largest economy by 2050 with the worldas 
third-largest middle class.   The world could also face more uncertainties by then with greater challenges to geopolitics and geoeconomics, Widodo said.   aStagnation of economic growth and even the recession of the economy 
are looming large and it is feared that the values of democracy and 
diversity are becoming more marginalized,a Widodo said through an 
interpreter.   aIn the midst of the enormous challenges, Indonesia and Australia must focus on strengthening the partnership,a he added.   Indonesia is Australiaas closest neighbor after Papua New Guinea. But
 the two countries rank as only each otheras 13th most important partner
 in terms of bilateral trade.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who underscored the importance of the 
bilateral relationship by making Jakarta the destination of his first 
overseas trip as national leader in 2018, described Indonesia as aone of
 the star economies of the world over the next 10 to 20 years.a   Morrison said the multifaceted free trade deal which will take effect
 early this year would be mutually beneficial for both countries.   Monash University, Australiaas largest, will open its first overseas campus in Indonesia under the agreement.   Widodo said he hoped Australia would become an important partner in infrastructure investment as well as education.   The Australian and Indonesian leaders emphasized the closeness of 
their relationship by sharing an informal dinner at the prime ministeras
 residence on Saturday with their foreign ministers but no other 
officials.   Morrison said Governor-General David Hurley had taken the two leaders
 on a aroo toura on Saturday a a golf buggy trip around the grounds of 
Government House to see the many kangaroos.   Morrison thanked Indonesia for sending army engineers and emergency 
crews to help rebuild after recent wildfires. They are now responding to
 widespread flooding in southeast Australia.   Widodo only used English during his speech to Parliament to say: aA friend in need is a friend indeeda and: aGood day, mate.a  "

free-trade agreement with Australia will lead to improved relations with
 its neighbor, with education and services a key focus of the deal.   aThis
 means in the next five years our bilateral relations will better

Canberra on Monday. aGoing forward, economic relations between the two 
countries will grow and bring more tangible benefits for the people.a       Joko Widodo with Scott Morrison in Canberra on Feb. 10.   Photographer: Mark Graham/Bloomberg   Indonesiaas
 often-strained relations with Australia are on the upswing, and on 
Monday Jokowi became the first Indonesian leader to address Australiaas 
parliament since Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2010. The deal, which has 
now been ratified by both nations and is expected to be enforced 
imminently, was inked 10 months ago after more than eight years of 
negotiations and 11th-hour delays, underlining the sometimes terse ties 
between the two countries.   The visit has been heavily focused on the nationsa economic 
relationship, viewed as underdeveloped considering their geographical 
proximity. A series on diplomatic tensions and scandals have hindered 
ties between Australia and Southeast Asiaas biggest economy, which is 
also the worldas largest Muslim-majority country.   Along
 with completing the free-trade agreement, which Trade Minister Simon 
Birmingham expects will be implemented by May, Australia has also agreed
 to look at simplifying visa entry for Indonesians, while it was 
announced Melbourneas Monash University will become the first Australian
 campus to open in the country.   The nations also agreed to establish an aenergy dialogue,a 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters, ensuring the afuel sources
 for the future are very much part of Indonesiaas development and 
Australiaas.a   Two-way trade and investment between the nations is 
relatively small and significantly lags other nations in the region, 
including Singapore ( $30.4 billion ) and Malaysia ( $16.7 billion ). It was worth  $7.8 billion  last year, down from the  $10.5 billion 
 recorded in 2014, according to Indonesian Trade Ministry data. Over 
that same period, Australiaas trade surplus with Indonesia has steadily 
grown from  $700 million  to  $3.2 billion .   The deal will see more than 99% of Australian goods exports 
to Indonesia enter duty free or under significantly improved and 
preferential arrangements, while Australia will immediately eliminate 
all remaining tariffs on imports from Indonesia.   While Australiaas agriculture exports, including wheat, live animals and sugar, were valued at A $2.8 billion  in 2018, services including education led the way, with two-way trade valued at A $5.8 billion  that year.   The deal 
 will allow Australian-owned companies to invest in more Indonesian 
assets, supply mining and energy-related services, and operate railway 
in road transport infrastructure.   The deal paves the way for Indonesia to boost exports of 
petroleum, furniture, wood products and footwear. It opens the door for 
Australiaas education sector in Indonesia, something that pleases Jokowi
 as he looks to up-skill a labor force the size of the combined 
populations of Germany and South Korea. Of the 127 million Indonesians 
with jobs, less than 10% have a university degree.   Jokowi also 
sees the deal as an opportunity to address the countryas overall trade 
shortfall and current account deficit. Indonesia posted a trade deficit 
of  $3.2 billion  last year, after recording a record  $8.6 billion 
 shortfall in 2018, while the central bank says the current account 
deficit narrowed to about 2.7% of gross domestic product last year.   The
 relationship has been tested many times, from revelations Australia 
attempted to tap the phone of Yudhoyonoas wife to issues over 
asylum-seeker boats, and the live cattle trade. More recently, Morrison 
caused a diplomatic row when he suggested Australia could formally 
recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there.   Morrison
 said the two nations will seek to increase cooperation on maritime 
security, as Indonesia shares aour commitment to sovereignty, stability 
and respect for the rule of international lawa in the South China Sea.  "

 no passengers showed signs of the deadly virus, Qantas took extreme 
measures to quarantine the Boeing 747-400 after the Tuesday 
flight.    The Qantas flight left the Chinese coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan early Sunday morning   'Rubbish
 and items in the cabin like pillows, blankets, magazines and headphones
 were removed and disposed of through quarantine. These items were 
replaced with brand new items,' a Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail 
Australia.   'The entire aircraft cabin was sprayed twice with hospital-grade disinfectant which kills the  coronavirus .'   'This includes all seats, floors, arm rests, tray tables, overhead luggage bins and walls.'   During
 the flight, the air in the cabin was replaced every three-to-five 
minutes with HEPA filters - also used in hospital operating theatres.   All filters were destroyed after the flight and refitted with new ones.   The rigorous cleaning process will be repeated for the items on board the Sunday flight.    Passengers wear protective face masks as they arrive from Shenzhen to Hong Kong   The
 spokeswoman said the cleaning efforts went above and beyond the 
policies introduced after the SARS crisis in 2003 for planes returning 
from affected areas.    More than 90 children were among the evacuees who arrived on Sunday.   After
 undergoing four health screenings that confirmed all passengers were 
'physically well', they were sent to the Manigurr-ma Village, a former 
mining camp at Howard Springs, 30km from Darwin.   Evacuees 
who arrived in Darwin on Sunday (pictured) were transported to Howard 
Springs, where they will spend the next fortnight in quarantine   The
 evacuees were initially expected to be quarantined on Christmas Island 
but were redirected to Darwin because the island facility was unable to 
accommodate another couple of hundred people.   Up to 100 Australians still remain in Wuhan.    There

 (Reuters) - Monash University has won approval to set up the first 
foreign university campus in Indonesia, the Australian institution said 
on Monday, as Southeast Asiaas biggest economy moves to free up  areas 
of restricted investment.    Indonesia has a big and young 
population, but the OECD grouping of rich nations says just about 16% of
 its young adults have attained a tertiary education.    President 
Joko Widodo signed a free trade deal with Prime Minister Scott Morrison 
in Australiaas capital of Canberra after the parliaments of both 
countries ratified the pact.    The campus awill contribute 
powerfully to Indonesiaas economic, social and technological 
development,a Morrison told Australiaas parliament.     Though 
neighbors, the two are not top economic partners and the 
Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement aims to
 boost lagging trade and investment.     The deal, agreed last year 
by the trade ministers of the two nations in the Indonesian capital of 
Jakarta, also allows Australia to invest in higher education in 
Indonesia, a sector previously closed to foreign business.    Monash
 Indonesia will offer studies for Masteras and PhD degrees, as well as 
executive programs and other offerings,    the universityas president, 
Margaret Gardner, said in a statement.     The Melbourne-based 
university will begin short executive programs this year and enroll 
Masteras degree students in the fourth quarter of 2021, it said.    Tariffs
 to be scrapped under the newly ratified deal include barriers to 
Australian agricultural exports and Indonesian-made footwear and 
textiles.    Indonesia will also push for car exports to Australia 
as Jakarta develops more capacity to produce hybrid and electric 
vehicles, Airlangga Hartarto, its chief economic affairs minister, said 
in a statement.    Australia valued trade between the neighbors at 
A$17.8 billion ($12 billion) in 2018-2019, making Indonesia its 13th

 footage appearing to show the fin of a great white shark in a murky 
Sydney lagoon may in fact have been a floating tree branch.     Vision
 which appeared to show the dorsal fin in the water at Narrabeen went 
viral on Sunday as low-lying homes in the coastal suburb were flooded 
during a wild storm.   But locals have since cast doubt on the authenticity of the grainy footage, with one woman claiming the fin was actually a log.   'It was a log. It floated past our house. We thought it was a shark at first,' she said.   Other
 eagle-eyed viewers questioned why the apparent shark appeared to 
bob in the water, while some claimed the fin was actually an upside down
 surfboard.    While great white and bull sharks have previously washed up in floodwaters, the latest sighting is yet to be verified.   Log or great white shark? Grainy footage of a flooded Narrabeen Lagoon has sparked debate     The NSW Department of Primary Industries said it couldn't confirm whether it was a shark from the footage.   'NSWDPI is unable to identify the object in the water as a shark,' a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.   'NSWDPI advises ocean goers to be SharkSmart with heavy rain making ocean conditions turbid and murky.'     Photos online appeared to show a shark warning sign erected near the shore at Narrabeen Lagoon on Monday.   Despite
 the ominous warning, local residents and holidaymakers from a caravan 
park across the road were seen swimming in the water on Monday.   One
 group was filmed using a homemade slip and slide to drop into the 
water, just metres away from where the apparent fin was spotted on 
Sunday.     The Airbnb host who filmed the footage 
claimed it was the fin of a great white shark, but others disagreed, 
saying it was a floating log    It's not the first time a shark has been spotted in the area.    There
 have been 12 sightings in the Narrabeen/North Narrabeen area in the 
last four years, according to the Dorsal Watch website dedicated to 
shark sightings.   Among them was a one metre bull shark reportedly spotted at the entrance of Narrabeen Lagoon in April 2016.   'I
 saw its dorsal fin chasing a school of what looked like poddy mullet 
from where I was fishing on the sandbank,' they told the Dorsal Watch 
website at the time.   The department stated at the time aerial 
contractors spotted 'a large figure' in deep water near Narrabeen shark 
nets but were unable to identify it, the website stated.   Fisherman Stephen Burleigh claimed he spotted a shark dragging a duck under the water in the lagoon in 2007.   'There
 were half a dozen ducks in the water. I saw four of them moving very 
quickly to the side but the shark got one and dragged it under the 
water, five metres under,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald at the 
time.   'I was worried if there were any children in the water. I stepped back and said ''I'm not fishing here any more''.'   The
 lagoon is opened up to the ocean during heavy rainfall in a bid to 
reduce the impact of flash flooding on waterfront properties in the 
suburb.    This shark warning sign in Monash Reserve 
near the Georges River inundated with water on Monday has been there for
 more than 20 years   NSW Police raised the alarm further 
among Sydneysiders on Monday when it shared a photo of shark warning 
sign spotted in a flooded reserve near the Georges River in city's 
south-west.    'Monash Reserve, East Hills - Another reason not to enter flood water,' police captioned the photo on its social media accounts.   A NSW Police spokeswoman assured Daily Mail Australia the sign was legitimate.   But many sceptics who commented online saw the funny side and thought it was a joke.   The signage is real and has been there for many years, according to City of Canterbury Bankstown Council.   'Signage
 indicating the presence of sharks along the Georges River has existed 
for more than 20 years,' a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.    A two metre shark was reportedly spotted in the river in nearby Moorebank in November, 2016, according to Dorsal Watch.   In April 2017, a bull shark was found washed up in the Brisbane suburb of Logan in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie.    A bull shark was found in a puddle in Townsville, north of where Cyclone Debbie made landfall, in 2017   The
 dead carcass was spotted several days after North Queensland television
 journalist found a metre-and-a-half bull shark in a puddle in Ayr near 
Townsville, just north of where Cyclone Debbie made landfall.   Bull
 sharks take advantage of floods to move further inland, according to 
Australian Institute of Marine Science fish and shark biologist Dr Mark 
Meekan.    'Bull sharks are one of a few sharks that can go 
completely into fresh waters, so they can sometimes appear in unexpected
 places,' he told The New Daily in 2017.   'They're attracted to 
floodwaters because there are often cattle, sheep and domestic animals 
trapped or dead carcasses washed down in floods, so it provides a nice 
feeding opportunity for those sharks.   'They also like to pup 
(breed) where the fresh water meets the salt of the sea. It's a refuge 
for them away from the other bigger sharks out in the open water.'   In
 2011, a shopkeeper spotted a six-foot bull shark swimming in flooded 
waters near afast food outlet in Goodna, just outside Brisbanea 12 miles
 inland from the sea.   In April 2017, a bull shark (above) was found washed up in the Brisbane suburb of Logan in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie   "

 discrimination of malignant masses is crucial for accurate diagnosis 
and prompt referral to a gynae oncology centre for optimal surgical 
intervention. HGSOC progression is correlated with local and systemic 
inflammation. We hypothesised that inclusion of inflammatory biomarkers 
in sera may improve diagnostic tests. In the training cohort, we tested 
four existing clinical tests (RMI score and ROMA, CA125 and HE4) and a 
panel of 28 immune soluble biomarkers in sera from 66 patients 
undergoing surgery for suspected ovarian cancer. Six promising immune 
biomarkers alone, or in combination with conventional tests, were 
subsequently analysed in an independent validation cohort (na=a69). IL-6
 was identified as the main driver of variability followed closely by 
conventional diagnostic tests. Median sera IL-6 was higher in HGSOC 
patients compared to those with a benign mass or controls with normal 
ovaries (28.3 vs 7.3 vs 1.2apg/ml, pa&lt;a0.0001). The combination of 
IL-6 further improved the overall predictive probability of the 
conventional tests. Modelling a two-step triage of women with a 
suspicious ovarian mass, with IL-6a&gt;a3.75apg/ml as primary triage 
followed by conventional tests (CA125 or RMI score) identified ovarian 
cancer in patients with a misclassification rate of 4.54a3.03%, superior
 to the use of CA125 or RMI alone (9.09 to 10.60). The validation cohort
 demonstrated a similar improvement in the diagnostic sensitivity 
following addition of IL-6. IL-6 in combination with conventional tests 
may be a useful clinical biomarker for triage of patients with a 
suspected malignant ovarian mass.   Epithelial
 ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. 
High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most aggressive 
subtype and generally presents at an advanced stage  1  . Although the 5-year survival rate increased significantly from 36% in 1986a1990 to 46% in 2011a2015  2  ,
 the prognosis for women with advanced ovarian cancer remains poor due 
to its late presentation and the lack of scientifically validated 
screening tools  2 , 3  .
 Optimal surgical cytoreduction as part of a multidisciplinary team, 
remains an important prognostic factor in ovarian cancer management and 
survival  4  .
 Pre-operative discrimination of ovarian carcinoma from non-malignant 
pelvic masses is crucial to ensure correct diagnosis and prompt referral
 to a specialist center, and subsequent optimization of primary 
treatment to improve survival.   A definitive predictive biomarker 
has not yet been identified. Standard investigation tools for adnexal 
masses currently in place are clinical examination, assays of tumour 
markers and ultrasound assessment. None of these tools is very sensitive
 or specific for predicting malignancy when considered separately.   Serum
 CA125, a glycoprotein antigen, is found at elevated levels in 1% of 
healthy individuals, 6% of patients with benign ovarian mass, as well as
 other malignancies  5   and physiological states, including pregnancy, endometriosis and menstruation  6  .
 Serum CA125 levels are raised above 35aU/mL in 78% of women with 
malignant ovarian mass, but also in 22% of women with benign masses  7  .
 Therefore, serum CA125, when used alone, is not highly reliable in 
differentiating patients with malignant compared to benign masses  8  . In a review by Jacobs and Bast  et. al ,
 while only about 50% of patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer
 had elevated levels of CA125, highest levels were seen in more than 90%
 of women with advanced stages  6  .
 CA-125 has greater sensitivity and specificity in postmenopausal women 
than in those who are premenopausal. In a study by Grzybowski W  et. al ,
 the sensitivity and specificity of CA125 among postmenopausal women 
with ovarian cancer were higher at 88.7% and 98.07% respectively, while 
in the premenopausal cohort sensitivity was only 64.0% and specificity 
94.1%  9  .   The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI), an algorithm developed by Jacobs  et al . in 1990  10  ,
 is the most widely used risk assessment for ovarian malignancy and is 
valuable for selective referral to a specialist center. RMI (at a 
threshold of &gt;200) has an improved sensitivity of 87% and specificity
 of 97% for ovarian cancer  11  
 compared to CA125 alone. The RMI score is generated by a simplified 
regression equation of serum CA125 level, menopausal status scores and 
ultrasound feature scores (RMIa=aultrasound findings x menopause status x
 CA125 U/ml)  10  .
 RMI stratifies patients into high or low risk based on a numerical 
score, with RMI &gt;200 considered as high risk, with a likelihood of 
having a malignant tumour of 75%  12  ,
 therefore requiring urgent assessment by a gynaecological oncologist to
 ensure optimal treatment outcome. Although the RMI score is highly 
sensitive and specific, it requires ultrasound imaging scoring  13  .
 In facilities with no ultrasound readily available, RMI scoring is 
underutilized to predict malignancy pre-operatively, and in facilities 
with multiple imaging modalities, the lack of standardization across 
imaging methods, and dependence on subjective operator assessment can 
highly influence the variability in RMI scores  13  .   Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is a relatively new serum biomarker for the detection of ovarian cancer  14 , 15  . HE4, a transcript of WFDC2 gene on chromosome 20  16  ,
 was originally found to be expressed in human epididymis. HE4 is also 
expressed in normal tissues including respiratory and reproductive tract  17  . The overexpression of HE4 gene in ovarian cancer was discovered in 1999 by Shummer  et al .  18  . In 2003, HE4 was reported as a promising serum biomarker for detection of ovarian cancer  19  .
 A meta-analysis of nine studies involving 1807 women reported that the 
pooled sensitivity and specificity for HE4 in diagnosing ovarian cancer 
were 83% and 90% respectively with a summarized ROC curve of 0.9271  20  .
 HE4 alone performed similarly when the ROC curve was compared with 
CA125, except CA125 performed better among postmenopausal women, while 
HE4 correlated inversely with age  15 , 21  . HE4 emerged as a potential lead biomarker out of nine analytes tested by Moore  et al .  21  ,
 who proposed it to be incorporated with CA125 and menopausal status 
into an algorithm to predict ovarian cancer. An alternative risk of 
malignancy algorithm (ROMA) combines CA125 and HE4 values along with the
 menopausal status into a predictive index, which in turn is used to 
calculate the predicted probability of ovarian cancer (from 0 to 100%). 
This has been shown to successfully stratify patients into high and low 
risk groups with 93.8% of ovarian cancer correctly classified as high 
risk  22  .
 The disadvantage of this algorithm is the use of HE4 which is an 
expensive test and is not readily available in low- or middle-income 
countries.   Components of the inflammatory and immunosuppressive 
pathway including systemic cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-a, IL-10, 
TGF- I2 ) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL10) in the ovarian cancer 
microenvironment have been shown to contribute to the development of 
carcinogenesis  23 , 24 , 25  .
 Cytokines and chemokines are cell signaling molecules that are 
essential to help cell to cell communication in the regulation of 
immunity, inflammation and hematopoiesis  23  .   We
 hypothesized that inclusion of inflammatory or immunosuppressive 
biomarkers present in serum or plasma may enhance or complement the 
identification of malignancy in patients with HGSOC, above current 
diagnostic methods including CA125, RMI, HE4 and ROMA.   This
 study is a part of the Immunity and Ovarian Cancer trial (Project 
13/32) and has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee 
(HREC) of the Royal Womenas Hospital, Melbourne. The clinical research 
study was carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and 
regulations. A total of 80 women undergoing ovarian removal surgery and 
who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria (Table  1 ) were initially recruited following signed written informed consent. Following the strict exclusion study criteria (Table  1 ),
 fourteen women were excluded from the study. The reasons for exclusion 
were significant concomitant heart, liver and vascular disease (na=a3), 
taking immunosuppressive drugs (na=a4) and having a concomitant active 
cancer such as breast and colorectal cancer (na=a3) as well as an 
ovarian cancer other than high-grade serous type (na=a4). Sixty-six 
women were finally enrolled and constituted the final sample for the 
training phase of the study. Thirty-three women had newly diagnosed 
HGSOC, 12 women had benign ovarian masses and the control group 
consisted of 21 women undergoing risk reduction surgery for a known 
genetic mutation (e.g. BRCA or Lynch syndrome) or a strong family 
history of ovarian and/or breast cancers.   All relevant clinical 
information including age, self-reported menopausal status, pre-existing
 medical conditions and drug history, and any prior history of 
malignancy were obtained from de-identified patient medical records. 
Venous blood samples were obtained from patients prior to any surgical 
or chemotherapy treatment. Baseline blood components, serum CA125 levels
 and pelvic ultrasound reports were collected for all patients. 
Following surgery, relevant documentation on final diagnosis, surgical 
staging findings and a thorough histological assessment of tumour type, 
stage and grade following multidisciplinary team consensus were 
obtained. Patientas tumours were staged according to the criteria of the
 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Patient 
details immediately relevant to this study are provided in Table  2 .   The
 validation phase consisted of clinical samples obtained through the 
OCRF-sponsored Ovarian Cancer Tissue Banking program located at the 
Hudson Institute, Australia. Ethical approval was obtained from the 
Epworth Human Research Ethics Committee EH2016-165. The clinical 
research study was carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines 
and regulations. All participants provided prior informed written 
consent. A total of 50 women undergoing surgery for a suspected ovarian 
mass during the period 2014a2016 were included in the study. For 
independent sub-analysis, we also obtained blood from ten women with 
histologically confirmed endometriosis. We also recruited 19 healthy 
volunteers at the Royal Women Hospital and Monash University, Australia 
following informed written consent and ethical approval from the 
institutionas research board.   The validation phase cohorts were 
not pre-selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria that were
 used in the training phase study. Therefore, 7 out of 25 patients with 
HGSOC and 5 out 25 women with benign ovarian masses had complex medical 
co-morbidities such as major cardiovascular diseases, complicated or 
uncontrolled medical conditions, active autoimmune disease as well 
immune suppressing medications (Supplementary Table  1 ).
 All relevant clinical information, including age, self-reported 
menopausal status, pre-existing conditions or medications, any prior 
history of malignancy, comprehensive histological assessment of tumour 
type, stage and grade by qualified gynaecological oncologists were 
obtained from de-identified patient medical records. Venous blood 
samples were obtained from anaesthetized patients prior to any surgical 
or chemotherapy treatment. Measurement of serum CA125 for all study 
patients was performed in the diagnostic pathology laboratory, either at
 the Monash Medical Centre or Royal Women Hospital, Melbourne, 
Australia.   Serum and 
plasma were isolated from whole blood collected either in serum 
separation tubes (primary cohort) or EDTA-coated tubes (validation 
study) by centrifugation at 3000arpm for 10aminutes. All blood samples 
were separated within less than 3ahours of being obtained. After 
removing cellular and protein debris, serum/plasma was aliquoted and 
stored at a80aAdegC until later use. Blood parameters i.e. hemoglobin (Hb),
 platelet count (PLT), white cell count (WCC), absolute neutrophil count
 (ANC), total lymphocyte count (TLC) and serum CA125 were routinely 
determined in all patients suspected of ovarian cancer and prior to 
surgery.   Multiplex
 magnetic bead immunoassay kits were used as per manufactureras protocol
 (Invitrogen) to simultaneously measure 28 numerous analytes in a single
 sample. Human 25-Plex panel was used to determine quantitative 
measurement of cytokines (GM-CSF, IFN-I+-, IFN-I3, IL-1I2, IL-1RA, IL-2, 
IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p40/p70), IL-13, 
IL-15, IL-17 and TNF-I+-) and chemokines (RANTES, Eotaxin, CCL2/MCP-1, 
CCL3/MIP-1alpha, CCL4/ MIP-1beta, CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10) in study 
serum. This 25-Plex panel was combined with singleplex cytokine beads 
sTNFRII and CCL22/MDC purchased separately. TGF-I2 was analysed 
separately using a singleplex bead kit. HE4 was assayed using R&amp;D 
human pre-mixed magnetic Luminex assay kit.   For
 the validation study, a 6-panel kit consisting of IFN-I3, IL-1RA, IL-6, 
IL-10, TNF-I+-, sTNFRII was used and TGF-I2 and HE4 were assayed as a 
singleplex kit.   Both the training and validation phases were 
analysed using the same assay protocol. Prior to analysis, serum samples
 were completely thawed, clarified by centrifugation (1000ag for 
10amins) and filtered to prevent clogging of the filter plates. Serum 
samples for TGF-I2 assay required acid-treatment and neutralization to 
remove latency associated peptide from TGF-I21 prior to use in assay. The
 serum samples were randomly assigned to the plates to avoid assay bias 
and were analysed in duplicates to determine inter-assay differences. A 
filter-bottom, 96-well microplate was coated with 25aI 1/4 l antibody-coated 
beads. A standard curve was made by serially diluting the human cytokine
 standard cocktail in assay diluent. Standards were pipetted at 100aI 1/4 l 
per well in duplicates, while patient sera were pipetted at 50aI 1/4 l per 
well in duplicates. 50aI 1/4 l of assay diluent was added to the standards 
and patient samples, and 50aI 1/4 l of incubation buffer was added to all 
wells. The plates were incubated for 2ahours at room temperature on an 
orbital shaker at 500a600arpm in the dark at room temperature. Wells 
were washed twice using a magnetic separator. A cocktail of biotinylated
 secondary antibodies was added, and the microplate was incubated for an
 hour in the dark on a microtiter shaker. Following twice washing with 
magnetic separator, streptavidin-phytoerythrin was added and incubated 
under agitation for 30aminutes in the dark at room temperature. The 
plate was washed for three times and 100aI 1/4 l of wash solution was added 
to each well and the samples were analysed using LuminexA(r) 200TM analyser
 (Luminex Corp) as per standard protocol. For each analyte, 100 beads 
were analysed and the median fluorescence intensity was determined. 
Analysis of median fluorescence intensities was performed using 
five-parameter logistic curve fitting to the standard analyte values. 
The inter-assay variability of each assay was 2% to 8% and the 
intra-assay variability was 2% to 7%.   The
 RMI (Risk of Malignancy index) score was calculated based on menopausal
 status (M), serum CA125 concentration and ultrasound scores (U) for all
 patients. The equation used:    $$RMI={Ux}\,{Mx}\,{CA125}\,{concentration}\,{in}\,{plasma}\,{or}\,{serum}$$    where:
 M-menopausal status-(1a=apremenopausal, 3a=apostmenopausal), 
U-ultrasound scores- features include bilateral mass, presence of solid 
areas, multi-loculated cyst, intra-abdominal metastases and ascites  10  . Each feature assigned a score 0, 1 or 3. (0a=aimaging score of 0, 1a=aimaging score of 1, 3a=aimaging score of 2a5).  CA125  a the actual concentration in IU/ml is used.   ROMA
 (Risk of Malignancy algorithm) was calculated using biomarkers HE4 and 
CA125 based on logistic regression formula developed by Moore  et al .  22  :    $$\begin{array}{rcl}{\rm{Premenopausal}}:{\boldsymbol{Predictive}}\,{\boldsymbol{Index}}({\boldsymbol{PI}})

 this was an exploratory, observational study, there was no formal, 
documented statistical analysis plan. The research team agreed that a 
variety of parametric and non-parametric approaches (for supervised 
learning) would be applied to one data set to detect a signal and that a
 second data set would be used to check, or validate, the learning.   Table  2 
 The continuous variable of three groups were analysed primarily using 
non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by secondary analysis 
using Dunnas multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism. The results 
were reported in meanaA+-astandard deviation (SD). For categorical 
variables involving three groups, primary analysis was performed using 
Freeman-Halton extension of Fisheras exact test to compute the 
(two-tailed) probability of the distribution of the categorical values 
in 3aAa2 or 3aAa3 contingency table using Graphpad Prism.   For Fig.  1  One-way analyses of variance were conducted on each of the 30 log 2 -transformed
 immune factors including CA125 and HE4 (Interleukin-17 was not 
statistically analysed as all values were below the detection limit and 
was excluded from analysis). For each immune factor, the three pairwise 
contrasts of means, malignant tumour versus normal/healthy control, 
benign tumour versus normal/healthy control and malignant tumour versus 
benign tumour, and their standard errors of differences, were calculated
 and the results of the pairwise t-tests were summarized in a volcano 
plot of statistical significance, alog 10 ( P -value), versus fold change, namely the difference in the group means of the log 2 -transformed
 cytokine concentrations. For each analysis of variance, diagnostic 
residual plots, including normal and half-normal probability plots, were
 examined to check the assumptions on which the analysis was based (viz 
homogeneity of the variance, and normality, of the residuals).

using binomial logistic regression. Good risk prediction models will 
have an AUC greater than 0.7  26  , and the most informative biomarker will increase AUC by 0.005 or more  27  .

 The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value 
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed by receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves in SPSS. The accuracy can be 
defined as the percentage of correctly classified instances 
(TPa+aTN)/(TPa+aTNa+aFPa+aFN), where TP, FN, FP and TN represent the 
number of true positives, false negatives, false positives and true 
negatives, respectively. Misclassification is calculated as the 
percentage of falsely classified instances 
(FPa+aFN)/(TPa+aTNa+aFPa+aFN).   For Fig.  5AaC 
 The method of recursive partitioning was used to identify cytokines and
 components of the RMI and ROMA indices that were associated with the 
disease status (normal, benign or malignant) of the patients in the 
training phase. In a second stage of investigations, the most promising 
cytokines were evaluated in trees that included either the CA125 alone, 
RMI index or the ROMA algorithm. Three types of tree were evaluated 
(each type consisting of the combination of relevant cytokines with one 
of the three conventional indices). For each type, the tree with the 
minimum value of the Gini index (this is the default in rpart) was 
selected subject to the constraint of a minimum node size (bucket size) 
of 10. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), 
negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy and misclassification rate 
were then calculated for components of conventional tests (RMI and ROMA)
 and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) alone or in combination at their cut-off
 levels used in the clinics with IL-6 level derived from the trees.

between patients with malignant (na=a33), benign (na=a12) and normal 
ovarian masses (na=a21) in the training phase. IL-6 levels were 
evaluated in trees in combination with either CA125 ( A ), RMI ( B ) or the ROMA index. ( C )

 Principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed to describe the 
variance of cytokine concentrations using SPSS. All the variables were 
transformed using log2 to reduce skewness prior to PCA. Resulting PCA 
component scores were extracted for analysis from overall data. 
Scree-test and eigenvaluesa&gt;a1.0 were used to determine the number of
 factors. The data was examined for intrinsic variation and whether any 
clustering was presented at this stage. Resulting PCA component scores 
were extracted for analysis. Secondary analysis was performed to check 
individual factor score values. All individual scores were plotted on a 
simple scatter plot, and the individuals were then categorized according
 to tumour status: malignant, benign and normal/healthy controls.

 of variance and ROC curve analyses were also conducted on the 
validation data set. The validation exercise was conducted by using the 
splitting rules associated with the classification trees that were 
derived from the training phase, to classify patients in the validation 
data set and to thereby form predictions of their status. These 
predictions of the status of the patients were then compared to the 
actual status of the patients in 3aAa3 contingency tables and Somersa D 
statistic was used to assess the agreement between predicted and actual 
status.   Graphpad Prism version 8.3.0 and SPSS IBM 23.0 were used 
for analyses of PCA, ROC curve and logistic regressions. GenStat 
(Version 17.1) was used for analyses of variance and estimation of 
contrasts of means. The R programming language (Version 3.3.2) was used 
to create the volcano plot, the rpart library was used to construct 
classification trees with minimum node size set to 10. The rattle 
library was used to draw the resulting trees. The SAS package (Version 
9.4) was used to calculate Somersa D.   All
 patients with ovarian cancer had Stage III-IV high-grade serous 
adenocarcinoma (na=a33) and the majority of patients with a benign 
ovarian mass (na=a12) had a serous cystadenoma (75%). No ovarian 
pathology was found in the patients undergoing risk reduction surgery 
for a genetic mutation or family history of hereditary breast or ovarian
 cancer (na=a21). The median age of patients with ovarian cancer and 
those with benign ovaries were 60 and 55 years respectively, while the 
median age for patients with normal ovaries was younger at 48 
(Table  2 ).
 There was no significant difference in the haemoglobin, platelet and 
white cell count and absolute neutrophil count level between the three 
groups of patients. The mean of total lymphocytes was significantly 
lower in ovarian cancer patients compared with those with benign ovarian
 mass (Table  2 ) and normal ovaries.   Figure  1 
 summarizes all 28 immune soluble factor concentrations measured using 
multiplex bead immunoassay analysed using one-way analyses of variances.
 The pair-wise t-tests and contrast of means between the three groups 
(malignant, benign and normal ovaries) were calculated for each immune 
soluble factor and summarized in the volcano plot analysis (Fig.  1 ).
 Immune factors IL-6 and IL8 in the pre-operative sera emerged as the 
only two cytokines with greater than a 2-fold change. Serum IL8 
concentrations were more than 2-fold different between patients with 
malignant and normal ovaries as well as between benign and normal 
ovaries (pa&lt;a0.05). Serum IL8 concentrations were not statistically 
different between patients with malignant and benign ovarian masses. 
Pre-operative IL-6 concentrations differences were greater than 2-fold 
in all three groups: malignant versus benign, benign vs normal and 
malignant versus normal ovaries (pa&lt;a0.05) (Fig.  1 ).   All
 collected blood factors and clinical parameters were further included 
in a PCA analysis. Given the age difference between patients with 
malignancy and normal ovaries, age as well as menopausal status were 
further incorporated as factors in the PCA. Four components with 
eigenvalues above one were extracted, indicating that they were the main
 contributors to the variability of the samples. Component 1 represented
 15.8% of total variances of the study groups. Component 1 included the 
conventional diagnostic tools and biomarkers, RMI score, ROMA, HE4 and 
CA125, as well as the immune factors IL-6 and IL8 (Supplementary 
Fig.  1 ).   These
 six factors were individually assessed for their ability to distinguish
 between the three groups of patients using Kruskal-Wallis analysis, 
followed by Dunnas multiple comparison test (Fig.  2 ).
 The median of RMI score in patients with HGSOC was significantly higher
 compared to those with benign ovarian masses and normal ovaries (3204 
vs 151 vs 10 IU/mL, pa=a0.001). Similarly, the mean of ROMA in patients 
with HGSOC was also significantly higher percentage at 88.4aA+-a12.4% 
median 89.3, range: 33.6a99.7%) compared to those with benign ovaries 
(19.9aA+-a13.4, median 23.78%) and normal ovaries (3.33%).   The 
patients with ovarian cancer had a higher mean of serum CA125 level 
(1125aA+-a2270, median 372, range: 29a10430 IU/mL) compared to those with 
benign masses (47.8aA+-a55.1, median:26, range: 5a177 IU/mL) and normal 
ovaries (15.1aA+-a29.9, median 8.0, range 5a145), adjusted pa=a0.0002 and 
0.0001 respectively. The serum levels of CA125 were not able to 
discriminate between those with benign and normal ovaries, (adjusted p 
value following Dunnas post-hoc test was 0.60). Although the median of 
CA125 levels among those in benign group was observed to be twice as 
high as those with normal ovaries, the adjusted p value was not 
significant at 0.60. This may be largely attributed to the small sample 
size of the benign group.   The mean HE4 level in patients with 
HGSOC was significantly higher (583aA+-a589, median 357.4, range: 
22.4a2060 pM) compared to those with benign ovaries (54.3aA+-a23.5, median
 50.6, range: 29.3a99.3 pM) and normal ovarian mass (38.4aA+-a16.3, median
 35.7, range: 18.9a81.3 pM). Following Kruskal-Wallis analysis and 
multiple comparisons with Dunnas test, serum HE4 was able to 
discriminate ovarian cancer from those with benign masses, as well with 
normal ovaries. Similar to CA125, the level of HE4 was not able to 
discriminate between benign and normal ovaries with adjusted p value of 
0.84.   The median level of IL-6 was higher in patients with HGSOC 
compared to benign ovarian masses or normal ovaries (28.3 vs 7.4 vs 
1.2apg/ml, pa=a0.0001) (Fig.  2 ).
 Using multiplex magnetic bead immunoassay kits, the level of 28 
analytes, including IL6 was measured. We found that the level of IL-6 
was below the level of detection in the serum of 28.5% (6/21) patients 
with normal ovaries in this study, while 6.7% (1/15) of patients with a 
benign ovarian mass and no patients with Stage III-IV HGSOC had an 
undetectable level. The majority of patients (97%) with Stage III-IV 
HGSOC had elevated IL-6 with a mean concentration of 40.4aA+-a40.6, range:
 5.6a215.88apg/ml compared to those with benign masses (6.8aA+-a3.0, 
range: 0.5a10.73apg/ml and normal ovaries (1.3aA+-a0.7, range 
0.5a2.8apg/ml), which was statistically significant following 
Kruskal-Wallis and Dunnas post-hoc analysis (Fig.  2 ).
 Therefore, IL-6 by itself could distinguish between the three study 
patient groups. A total of eighteen out of 33 (54.5%) patients had 
ascites in the training cohort. Significantly higher IL-6 levels were 
detected in patientsa ascites (median, 18,050apg/ml [range: 5162 to 
122,883apg/ml]) compared with serum (median, 53apg/ml [range: 11.2 to 
216apg/ml]) (pa=a0.0001). The presence of ascites did not correlate with
 higher levels of serum IL6 (pa=a0.09).   The mean serum IL8 
concentration in patients with ovarian cancer (3124aA+-a7336, median 
320.5, range: 48.6a37574apg/ml) were significantly higher when compared 
to healthy controls (262.4aA+-a368.6, median 165.7, range: 23.7a1694 
pg/ml, pa=a0.02). Serum IL8 was not able to distinguish between benign 
and malignant ovarian masses as elevated concentrations of IL8 were also
 observed in benign masses (1961aA+-a2400, median 1363, range: 
21.8a7965apg/ml), pa=a0.07. Although the median of IL8 levels among 
those in benign group is observed to be 1.5 times higher than those with
 normal ovaries, the adjusted p value following Dunnas post-hoc test was
 not significant. This may be largely attributed by the small sample 
size of the benign group. None of the other factors analysed could 
distinguish between the three study groups.   As RMI score and ROMA 
are the current diagnostic tests used in the prediction of malignancy to
 facilitate referral to specialized center, ROC (Receiver operator 
characteristic) analysis which combines the strengths of sensitivity and
 specificity was performed to calculate the area under curve (AUC), 
which summarizes overall test performance  28   (Fig.  3 ).
 The value of AUC was used to evaluate the performance of selected 
factors for the ability to discriminate between the groups (malignant vs
 benign, malignant vs normal and benign vs normal). The value closer to 
one indicates better discriminatory test performance, while AUCa=a0.50 
would suggest predictive accuracy equivalent to that of chance alone  29  .
 IL8 had an AUC value of 0.743 (95% CI 0.618a0.868), which show 
acceptable predictive ability to discriminate malignant and 
non-malignant patients but was not superior or comparable to AUC value 
of CA125 (0.986), HE4 (0.997), RMI score (0.987) or ROMA (0.998) 
(Fig.  3 ).
 By contrast IL-6 showed excellent predictive value in distinguishing 
between malignant and non-malignant patients (AUC 0.976, 95% CI 
0.948a1.000), comparable to the AUC value for conventional tests (RMI 
and ROMA) and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) (Fig.  3A ).
 The AUC value was also calculated for all immune factors and 
conventional tests between the three study groups: HGSOC vs benign 
ovarian mass, malignant vs normal ovaries and those with benign ovarian 
mass vs normal ovaries (Table  4 ).
 IL-6 alone (AUC 0.927) had a good predictive AUC value, similar but not
 superior to conventional tests and biomarkers to distinguish between 
malignant and benign ovarian patients (Table  3 ).
 The predictive ability of IL-6 was excellent (AUC 1.000) when it came 
to be discriminating between those with malignant and normal ovaries 
(Table  3 ).
 Furthermore, IL-6 (AUC 0.905) was superior to CA125 (AUC 0.73), HE4 
(AUC 0.84) or ROMA (AUC 0.84) in distinguishing between patients with a 
benign ovarian mass and normal ovaries (Table  4 ).
 Moreover, the combination of IL-6 with existing conventional diagnostic
 tools such as RMI score and ROMA or conventional biomarkers CA125 and 
HE4 improved the ability of the tests to identify patients with 
malignant ovaries (Table  3 , Figs.  3 , 4 ).   To
 evaluate the useful thresholds for combining IL-6 and conventional 
tests to discriminate disease status (normal, benign or malignant), 
classification and regression trees (CART) were fitted to the data in 
the training phase using recursive partitioning method. The analyses 
identified a serum concentration of IL-6 of less than 3.75apg/ml as 
informative for use as initial triage to identify patients with normal 
ovaries. In the three trees (Fig.  5AaC )
 selected for further investigation, 21/21 normal patients were 
correctly assigned to the anormala group at this threshold. In a second 
stage of the CART analyses, IL-6 was evaluated in trees in combination 
with either CA125, RMI index or ROMA index. IL-6 at less than 3.75apg/ml
 correctly identified all patients with normal ovaries as normal in all 
trees (Fig.  5AaC ).
 Inclusion of CA125 or RMI (at the thresholds resulting from CART 
analysis of the same dataset), into the IL-6-tree resulted in a decrease
 in the misclassification rate of CA125 or RMI alone (Table  4 ).
 Incorporating HE4 and ROMA into the IL-6-tree also improved the 
accuracy of discrimination of malignant disease, with the highest 
accuracy and zero misclassification rate seen in the combination of HE4 
and IL-6, and/or CA125 (Table  4 ).
 This system may offer therefore a more robust classification, with 
improved accuracy and lowered misclassification rates than observed for 
current methods as a result of the inclusion of IL-6 as demonstrated in 
this study (Table  4 ).   To
 evaluate the usefulness of the three IL-6-based classification, plasma 
samples from an independent cohort, including 25 patients with advanced 
stage high grade serous ovarian cancer, 25 patients with a benign 
ovarian mass and 19 healthy volunteers, were tested. The pre-treatment 
samples from this cohort were collected prospectively from 2014 and 
stored in a biobank till date of assay. The demographic characteristics 
of the second cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table  1 .
 In the cancer group, all patients with ovarian cancer had high-grade 
serous adenocarcinoma (HGSOC) (na=a25) and majority of patients with a 
benign ovarian mass (na=a25) had serous cystadenoma (60%). Healthy 
volunteers were recruited as the study control group (na=a19). The mean 
age of patients with ovarian cancer and those with a benign ovarian mass
 were similar, while healthy controls were relatively younger 
(Supplementary Table  1 ).
 In the validation cohort, a total of thirteen out of 25 (52.0%) 
patients had ascites. Similar to the training cohort, the presence of 
ascites did not correlate to higher levels of serum IL6 among the 
patients with HGSOC (pa=a0.19).   Pre-operative plasma in the 
validation phase cohort was analysed selectively for relevant cytokines 
including CA125 and HE4. PCA analysis of all demographic, blood 
components and immune factors, similar to the training cohort, revealed 
IL-6 as the one factor that clustered with RMI score, ROMA, CA125 and 
HE4 in component 1 which represented 32.4% of total variances in this 
study group (data not shown). These factors were then assessed for their
 discriminative ability between the three study groups using one-way 
ANOVA, followed by Dunnas multiple comparison test as post hoc 
(Supplementary Fig.  2 ).
 As observed in the training study, in this validation cohort, IL-6 and 
RMI, but not ROMA, remained discriminative markers for all three study 
groups. Plasma CA125 and HE4, similar to the training phase, displayed 
similar discriminative ability and were not able to distinguish between 
patients with a benign ovarian mass and healthy controls (Supplementary 
Fig.  2 ).   IL-6
 retained good predictive value in the validation phase by ROC analysis 
and was clearly able to distinguish malignant ovarian patients from 
their non-malignant counterparts (AUC 0.962, 95% CI 0.926a0.998, 
pa=a4.4aAa10 a11 ). The combination of IL-6 with conventional 
tests such as RMI score and ROMA or conventional biomarkers such as 
CA125 or HE4 similarly improved the predictive probability of malignant 
ovarian masses in the validation phase (Fig.  3 ).
 Comparison of the ROC curves of IL-6 alone or in combination with 
conventional tests and biomarkers between the three study groups in the 
validation phase revealed a similar pattern to training phase 
(Supplementary Table  2 ).   The
 patients in the validation phase were then classified by applying the 
splitting rules derived from the classification trees of the training 
phase dataset to enable predictions of their status. The predicted 
status of the patients was then compared to the actual status of the 
patients. Inclusion of IL-6 to the trees correctly classified all 19 
healthy control patients as normal, essentially eliminating false 
positives prior to incorporation of conventional tests and biomarkers. 
Of the three trees, the classification tree based on IL-6 and CA125 was 
the best (Somersa Da=a0.943aA+-a0.028) with 3 out of 25 malignant patients
 classified as benign and there were no false positives. In comparison, 
when CA125 is used alone, there were 2 cases of false positives. 
Similarly, but only marginally better, was the tree based on IL-6 and 
RMI (Somersa Da=a0.929aA+-a0.030) while the classification tree based on 
IL-6 and ROMA performed poorly (Somersa Da=a0.607aA+-a0.071) when it was 
tested on the validation data set. This reduction in goodness of fit, 
which was most evident in the tree that was based on IL-6 and ROMA, is 
more likely an example of the general phenomenon of aover fittinga 
rather than multiplicity. Invariably a statistical model constructed 
from one set of data does not perform as well on a new set of data. 
However, we believe we have demonstrated that the classification tree 
based on IL-6 and CA125 performs very well.   We also assessed the 
usefulness of IL-6 in helping to discriminate ovarian cancer patients. 
One of the features of endometrioma is the elevation of CA125 
concentration, which may be misleading or reduce the capacity to 
discriminate endometrioma from ovarian cancer. We obtained sera from ten
 patients with benign endometrioma and measured CA125 concentration and 
relevant cytokines including IL-6. The mean CA125 concentration was 
109.3aA+-a128.8 IU/L (median 81, range: 7.5a436 IU/L) which was 7-fold 
higher than the mean concentration of a serous cystadenoma 20.8aA+-a24.0 
IU/L (median 17, range: 7.0a129 IU/L), pa=a0.009. However, the mean IL-6
 concentration (1.33aA+-a0.90, median 1.2, range: 0.5 to 3.71apg/ml) in 
the plasma for these ten patients with endometrioma remained comparable 
to the mean concentration of IL-6 of patients with benign serous 
cystadenomas (1.15aA+-a0.52, median 1.4, range 0.5 to 2.79apg/ml), 
pa=a0.16. The concentration of IL-6 in the endometrioma group was still 
significantly lower by 6-fold compared to IL-6 concentration in the 
malignant diseases (pa=a1.0aAa10 a6 ). All concentration levels
 among women with endometrioma were also lower than the threshold point 
of 3.75apg/ml (Supplementary Fig.  3 ).   The
 present study shows for the first time that IL-6, a pro-inflammatory 
cytokine, overexpressed in sera or plasma of advanced high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer patients, is the single most informative cytokine out of 
28 soluble factors able to enhance the diagnostic efficiency of 
conventional tools (RMI and ROMA) and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) to 
discriminate between women with a malignant ovarian mass, benign ovarian
 pathology and healthy ovaries.   IL-6 had overall good predictive 
value to discriminate malignant ovarian masses in both training and 
validation cohorts, which was comparable to pre-existing current 
diagnostic tools- CA125, HE4, RMI score and ROMA. Specifically, in this 
study, IL-6 was an excellent predictive marker for distinguishing 
between advanced malignant and normal ovaries (AUC 1.000, pa=a7.8aAa10 a10 ).   In
 the present study, the median IL-6 level was 24-fold higher in advanced
 ovarian cancer patients than those with normal ovaries. The IL-6 level 
remained at a highly detectable rate in all patients with advanced 
ovarian cancer, while the level was undetectable in 23.8% of patients 
with normal ovaries in the training phase. While IL-6 can be produced by
 human ovarian epithelial cells during follicle development, the levels 
may not reach the detection threshold  30  .
 In contrast, excessive levels of circulating IL-6 are observed in 
advanced ovarian cancers and this may be contributed by either tumour 
cells or peritoneal mesothelial cells, both of which are major 
contributors to IL-6 production within the tumour microenvironment  31 , 32  .
 IL-6 in the malignant ascites, serum and plasma of patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer have been shown to correlate positively with 
advanced disease and poor survival  33 , 34 , 35 , 36  .
 The current study has demonstrated the diagnostic and predictive value 
of serum IL-6 alone and in combination with other markers in 
discriminating between malignant and non-malignant ovarian masses.   Past studies have reported higher levels of IL-6 in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer  37 , 38   and have incorporated it in complex multi-marker panels for the detection of ovarian cancer  27 , 39  .
 To the best of our knowledge, however, this is the only study analyzing
 the diagnostic value of blood IL-6 singly and in combination with the 
conventional tests (RMI and ROMA) and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) in 
advanced HGSOC patients.   IL-6 also had superior predictive value 
than CA125, HE4, and ROMA in distinguishing between the benign and 
normal ovaries group. Although CA125 (at a threshold of &gt;35 U/ml) has
 not achieved satisfactory sensitivity (81%) and specificity (75%) for 
ovarian cancer detection  6 , 40  , CA125 had been reported to have the highest sensitivity for serous subtypes and advanced stages  41  ,
 which was also evident in this study. In this study population, the 
sensitivity and specificity of serum CA125 level to discriminate between
 malignant and non-malignant masses were 96.0% and 79.5% respectively 
for the training cohort, while the validation group had a sensitivity of
 97.0 and specificity of 81.8%. The higher sensitivity and specificity 
of serum CA125 level observed maybe attributed to advanced stages of 
ovarian cancer and a higher percentage of post-menopausal women compared
 to those pre-menopausal. The training cohort consisted of twenty-four 
(36.4%) pre-menopausal and 42 (63.6%) post-menopausal women, while the 
validation group had 24 (34.8%) premenopausal and 45 (65.2%) 
post-menopausal women.   In the present study, IL-6 but not CA125, 
could distinguish between all three study groups in both the training 
and validation phase cohort. The median IL-6 levels in the training 
phase were observed to be 4.5-fold higher in benign ovaries compared to 
normal ovaries respectively. The use of CA125 in combination with IL-6, 
lowered false positive rates and achieved higher predictive values 
compared to CA125 alone. A similar pattern of improvement was also 
observed for RMI, HE4 or ROMA in combination with IL-6.   However, 
IL-6 alone was not superior to the predictive value of other 
conventional biomarkers and tests in distinguishing benign and malignant
 ovarian masses. Serum CA125 or RMI when used alone had higher false 
positive rates  41  .
 The combination of IL-6 and CA125 may be particularly useful in 
distinguishing ovarian endometrioma with falsely elevated CA125 from 
malignant disease. Comparable serum IL-6 levels were previously reported
 in women with and without endometriosis  42 , 43  , while other investigators have reported elevated levels of IL-6 in endometriosis patients compared with normal ovaries  44 , 45  .
 Although endometrioma may have elevated levels of IL-6, as observed in 
our pilot data, the serum IL-6 levels in women with endometrioma were 
lower than in women with ovarian cancer, in keeping with Darai  et al .  37  .
 Therefore, the addition of IL-6 to CA125 may be clinically helpful to 
distinguish endometrioma compared to use of CA125 alone; this however 
warrants evaluation in a larger cohort.   In our study, HE4 alone 
achieved good overall predictive value for patients with ovarian cancer 
in both the primary (AUC 0.997) and validation (AUC 0.889) cohorts. 
However, we found that HE4 had lower predictive value in comparison to 
CA125, when used as a discriminator between benign ovarian mass and 
normal ovaries, with AUC of 0.706 for the primary cohort and 0.497 for 
the validation cohort. The use of HE4 alone as a biomarker to 
distinguish between benign and normal ovaries therefore may not be 
reliable as shown in previous studies  15 , 46  .
 The introduction of ROMA which incorporates CA125 and HE4 has been 
promising as a more specific discriminator of the malignant ovarian mass  22 , 47  .
 In a prospective evaluation of pre-operative ovarian masses in an 
Australian cohort, ROMA was found not to be inferior to RMI in the 
detection of ovarian malignancy  47  .
 Similarly, in our study, ROMA had a good overall predictive value in 
both the primary (AUC 0.998) and the validation (AUC 0.996) study groups
 and was therefore a better predictive tool than HE4 alone or the RMI 
score in our study. In addition, the addition of IL-6 to ROMA enhanced 
the predictive probability of ROMA to achieve an AUC of 1.000 between 
all three study populations in this study. The addition of IL-6 to CA125
 and HE4 achieved an excellent sensitivity and specificity with the 
highest accuracy, and therefore may have a potential use in the 
pre-operative assessment for suspicious ovarian masses in less developed
 countries with poor access to imaging modalities.   There are limited studies available that might be used to define cut-off values for IL-6 as a diagnostic tool  48  .
 We found a good discriminatory value for IL-6 at a threshold of 
&gt;3.75apg/ml with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 76.8%, 
positive predictive value of 69.7%, and negative predictive value of 
100% in this study. This is an improvement to moderate sensitivity/ 
specificity characteristics reported for IL-6 (sensitivity of 61%, 
specificity of 79%, positive predictive value of 70%, and negative 
predictive value of 61%) by Tempfer  et al .  49  
 The difference may be explained by the selection of the study cohort 
used and the different threshold level for IL-6 being used compared to 
the current study. While we recruited a homogenous group of advanced 
FIGO stages (III-IV) HGSOC and compared this with benign cystadenoma and
 patients with normal ovaries, the previous study included all FIGO 
stages and various subtypes of ovarian cancer and the control group was 
healthy blood donors. The threshold level for IL-6 was also lower 
(0.78apg/ml) when compared to our study (3.75apg/ml). In both the 
training and validation cohorts, we have tried to include a similar age 
cohort for the control group with age ranging between 40 to 84 years 
old, however the control group were significantly younger compared to 
the cancer patients. As the levels of IL6 have been reported to be 
increased in older women, this data may have potential bias in regard to
 the threshold level of IL6. Future studies with age-matched control may
 need to be undertaken to validate the threshold level of IL6.   As 
cytokines are part of the immune system, which respond rapidly to both 
external and internal stimuli, cytokine measurements are highly 
sensitive and are subject to clinical applicability, reproducibility and
 quality assurance criteria to minimize result variation  24  .
 The strength of this study is that we recruited a homogenous ovarian 
cancer population where all of the women had advanced (Stage III-IV) 
high-grade serous ovarian / fallopian tube cancer and the benign group 
were mainly patients with a serous cystadenoma, with patients in the 
control group having their ovaries removed as part of risk reduction 
surgery. The training phase had a pre-selected population with exclusion
 of clinical conditions that might have interfered with levels of 
circulating cytokines. The concentration of IL-6 is largely affected by 
exercise, weight, stress, significant medical conditions and 
immunosuppressive drugs  24  .
 Sample collection and storage may also influence cytokine measurement, 
and this can affect the validity of the test. Sera samples were 
collected prior to surgical intervention. The use of lithium heparin and
 sodium citrate were avoided as it can decrease the measured levels for 
pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF  50  .
 In contrast, the patients recruited to the validation phase were not 
screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the 
training phase study. Therefore, these patients had complex medical 
co-morbidities such as major cardiovascular diseases, complicated or 
uncontrolled medical conditions, active autoimmune disease as well as 
taking immune suppressing medications. This cohort which may more 
closely reflect the true population encountered during clinical 
screening, not only allowed validation of IL-6 as a potential biomarker,
 but also likely demonstrated the true potential of IL-6 as a diagnostic
 biomarker.   The study is consistent with findings from Nowak  et al .,
 that patients with advanced ovarian cancer had higher level of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 in the serum. Thus, the result of our 
study supports the critical role of inflammation in ovarian cancer 
development and progression. As IL-6 plays a substantial role in 
promoting cancer cell proliferation  24  ,
 elevated concentration of IL-6 are observed not only in association 
with primary epithelial ovarian cancers, but also in a variety of other 
solid tumors including breast, lung and colorectal cancers, which can 
make diagnosis particularly challenging  24 , 51 , 52  .
 The possibility of metastatic breast, lung or bowel cancers merits 
consideration in the differential diagnosis for a woman with a 
suspicious ovarian mass and increased IL-6 concentration.   The 
potential use of peripheral blood IL-6 concentration as a screening tool
 is promising with IL-6 levels found significantly elevated in early 
stages (FIGO Stage I and II) of ovarian cancers compared to benign 
ovarian masses or healthy controls  39 , 53  .
 The use of IL6 may improve preoperative discrimination of suspected 
ovarian tumours, however the findings in this study alone are 
insufficient to support it for generalized ovarian screening. Given the 
small number of true early-stage, high-grade serous ovarian cancers 
available, it was necessary to make inferences using advanced disease 
cases. Inclusion of early stages of epithelial ovarian cancer and 
comparison with benign masses and normal ovaries in a larger 
stage-stratified cohort will be required to ascertain the role of IL6 in
 generalized ovarian cancer screening including multiple and earlier 
disease stages.   As with any exploratory, observational study, 
there is a risk of aover-fittinga a predictive model to the observed 
data, however inclusion in the study of a second data set to check the 
usefulness of the model goes some way to alleviating this risk, and we 
found that IL-6 was still able to accurately identify and triage all 19 
normal patients as normal in the validation study. The addition of IL-6 
to CA125 or to RMI was further validated as improving their diagnostic 
utility. Albeit, the analyses generated in the training cohort can be 
further optimized to specifically account for co-morbidities, given 
exclusion of these confounders resulted in an increased of ROC-AUC value
 from 0.962 to 0.985 and 0.993 respectively (Figs.  3  and  4 )
 for the capacity of IL-6 in the validation phase to distinguish between
 malignant and non-malignant ovarian mass. These findings therefore 
should be considered when using IL-6 in clinical screening as these will
 be potential confounders that may influence the levels of IL-6.   IL-6
 alone may be a clinically reliable biomarker to distinguish between 
patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and those 
with normal ovaries. In combination with RMI score, ROMA, HE4 or CA125, 
IL-6 may enhance the predictive power of existing conventional tools or 
biomarkers in distinguishing between patients with malignant and benign 
ovarian masses as well as those with a benign ovarian mass and normal 
ovaries. Patients with cysts incidentally identified on imaging could 
potentially be spared surgical intervention. These results indicate that
 IL-6 may be a useful diagnostic tool for the pre-operative assessment 
of suspicious ovarian masses. These results support further studies, 
including those including earlier stages of the disease, to explore and 
expand on, the potential utility of adding IL-6 to routine diagnostic 
tests.   Soslow, R. A. Histologic subtypes of ovarian carcinoma: an overview.  International Journal of Gynecological Pathology   27 , 161a174 (2008).

The
 new cases aboard the Diamond Princess are in addition to 70 cases 
previously announced aboard the luxury ship, bringing the total number 
of cases from the vessel to 135.    A Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade spokesman said the department is urgently seeking 
advice from Japanese authorities on new cases among Australians on the 
ship.   None of the 266 people in quarantine in Darwin after being evacuated from the coronavirus epicentre in  China  have shown any signs of the respiratory infection, medical authorities say.    Japanese
 military personnel set up a covered walkway next to the Diamond 
Princess cruise ship today where thousands of people are in 
quarantine    Four Australians are among more than
 65 newly-confirmed coronavirus cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship 
docked at Yokohama, Japanese authorities have confirmed    Five
 of the 15 confirmed Australian cases of coronavirus have been cleared, 
the government says, as it reassured those living near the Darwin 
evacuation centre that they are not at risk.   Local health 
officials confirmed that among the new infections were 45 Japanese 
nationals, 11 Americans, four Australians, three from the Philippines 
and one each from Canada and Ukraine.    The announcement last 
week that the Australians would be quarantined at a disused mining 
village near Darwin sparked anger among local parents, with the evacuees
 housed less than one kilometre from the Good Shepherd Lutheran College 
in Howard Springs.   While one mother said she would keep her 
teenage son home for at least the 14 days of the quarantine, Australia's
 deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said if he had children at the 
school, 'I would have no hesitation in my kids going to school today.'   The
 new cases aboard the Diamond Princess are in addition to 70 cases 
previously announced aboard the luxury ship, bringing the total number 
of cases from the vessel to 135. Officials in protective suits walk on 
board the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Yokohama today   The
 Northern Territory's Acting Chief Health Officer Dianne Stephens spoke 
at the school on Monday to reassure parents and said there was a lot of 
misinformation.   That included reports in China that the virus 
could be spread by airborne transmission, which has sparked fears 
schoolchildren could end up catching it from mosquitoes.   'We have 
investigated that at a national level, we have reached in to Chinese 
authorities and it is a misuse of the word airborne,' she told 
reporters.   'There has been no evidence of infection amongst any of
 those cohorts here or in Christmas Island, who are nearly halfway 
through their quarantine period   'It is definitely a droplet borne 
disease. If I am within one metre and I sneeze and cough on you and I 
have the novel coronavirus, then you are at risk of getting infected.'   Face masks help prevent droplet infection, she said.   Prof
 Stephens said it was unfortunate the community and school were not 
consulted about the quarantining but said the decision would not have 
been Face masks if it threatened anyone's safety.   A girl suspected
 of having coronavirus on far more remote Christmas Island, where a 
previous planeload of Australians was sent last week, has also tested 
negative.   A passenger stands on the balcony on board the Diamond Princess yesterday with guests facing further tests for coronavirus    The
 evacuees, including 92 children, at the Manigurr-ma Village at Howard 
Springs, were tired but in good spirits, said Abigail Trewin, a director
 with the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre.   They 
were receiving daily health checks and had been separated into smaller 
groups to prevent the virus spreading if anyone did have it, she said.   'The
 kids are super excited to be home on Aussie soil; there have been 
repeated thankyous for bringing people home, which is lovely to hear,' 
she said.   The number of cases worldwide has reached more than 
40,500 while more than 900 people have died from the virus, mainly in 
Wuhan where the outbreak began.   The virus is believed to have emerged in a market selling wild animals in Wuhan last year before spreading across China.

Around
 280 Australians will be isolated at the unused Inpex workers village in
 Howard Springs, 30km east of Darwin, after fleeing the coronavirus 
epicentre of Wuhan.     Good Shepherd Lutheran 
College notified parents at a meeting on Monday, but some felt 
authorities did not allow time to hear their concerns.     Now
 some parents plan to keep their children at home after reading the 
deadly disease could be transmitted through the air.    Pupils
 at Good Shepherd Lutheran College (pictured) are being withdrawn by 
their parents amid concerns they could be infected with the coronavirus    'Yeah, itas a bit of a joke,'  parent Beckie Kernich  told   NT News  about the lack of community consultation.      'Iam
 assured that thatas the information they have currently and thatas the 
information they believe and thatas the information theyare acting on, 
from my perspective thereas a lot of international information you can 
see immediately online which may put that into doubt.'       Ms Kernich said she was unsure if she would allow her teenage son to attend school when he is due back next week.     But mother-of-two Karen Donald said her children would be kept at home until the site is shut down.    NT
 deputy chief health officer Di Stephens has offered assurance the virus
 can only be spread through droplets during close personal 
contact.    She said those with the virus would have to cough, 
kiss or spit on someone, and those particles rubbed into someone's eyes 
for them to become ill.   The Inpex workers camp (pictured), 500 metres away from the school, is housing around 280 Australians for two weeks    Other parents are not worried their children will be infected.   Nicolette
 McCourt said social media allowed a lot of false and misleading 
information to circulate and her children would remain at school.   'Itas
 not airborne, itas only via droplets, thereas a 50-metre buffer zone 
between the village and our fence so thereas just no concerns for me,' 
she said.    She added that if her family had of been one of 
those caught up in the crisis overseas while visiting relatives, she 
would want the Australian government to provide her with the same 
treatment.   Hundreds of evacuees arrived at Howard Springs on 
Sunday, where they will spend the next two weeks housed at least 300 
metres within the facility and 500 metres from the school.   Australian
 evacuees from the Chinese city Wuhan arrive at the Inpex Plant 
Manigurr-ma Village in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, 9 
February    Evacuees were initially expected to be 
quarantined on Christmas Island, but that is at capacity with two 
flights from Wuhan already taken there.    The camp once housed 3,500 workers involved in Inpex's construction of a $55 billion gas plant on Darwin Harbour.   Those
 on board the first evacuation flight included 77 children, 11 infants 
and one 'less-than-able' 90-year-old man, the Australian Border Force 
said.    They were subject to tests for the coronavirus before 
and during the six-hour Qantas flight from Wuhan and upon landing 
and were unlikely to have the coronavirus.   The new viral 
outbreak that began in China has infected more than 40,546 people 
globally resulting in more than 910 deaths so far.        NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

Saturday will mark two weeks since Prime Minister  Scott Morrison 
 announced a temporary 14 day ban on foreign travellers who have 
left or passed through mainland China from arriving on our shores.    Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned the travel ban will likely be extended as the worldwide death toll surges towards 1000.   'We expect it will continue. We're not putting a timeframe on it,' the minister told  The Australian .   The
 tourism industry is paying a heavy price from Australia's temporary ban
 on Chinese travellers, which will likely be extended later this week   Mr Hunt added the government acted on the best medical advice to implement the ban.   'Ultimately,
 our job a| our responsibilAity, is to provide protection and national 
health security for the Australian people,' he said.    'They've been difficult decisAions but made on the basis of the medical advice and we'll implemenAt the medical advice.'   Australia
 currently has 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus while four Australians 
are among 65 newly-confirmed cases aboard the quarantined Diamond 
Princess cruise ship docked at Yokohama in Japan.    The 
federal government also admits the ban has taken a toll on the tourism 
industry, which is losing an estimated $1billion a week.   Qantas this week also enforced the temporary suspension of its two direct services to mainland China until March 28.   Up
 to 100,000 international students will be unable to return to 
Australia in time for the start of semester if the travel ban is 
extended   An extended travel ban will also impact Australia's $39 billion international education sector.    Universities'
 plans could be thrown into chaos if 100,000 international students are 
unable to return to Australia in time for the start of semester.   Some Australian universities have already delayed the start of the semester due to the coronavirus.    Federal education Minister Dan Tehan acknowledged extended bans could cause a major disruption.   'It's very much wait and see what happens,' Mr Tehan told Sky News on Sunday.   But
 my hope is that we will see some sort of a breakthrough and we will be 
able to get students here for the first semester, but we will have to 
wait and see.'     Foreign travellers who have 
recently left or passed through mainland China are currently banned from
 entering our shores. Pictured are visitors arriving in Brosbane before 
the ban was implemented.   More than 100 Australian residents remain stranded in the Chinese  coronavirus  epicentre of Wuhan after 266 'clinically well' evacuees arrived in Darwin on a chartered  Qantas  flight on Sunday.    A further 243 Australians who were on the first rescue flight from Wuhan are almost halfway through a 14-day quarantine on  Christmas  Island after landing on Tuesday.   The
 federal government has rejected desperate calls to put on a third 
evacuation flight from many of those trapped who missed out on selection
 for the second flight which departed Wuhan on Sunday morning.    They include to up a dozen unaccompanied minors, according to  Fairfax Media .   Around 266 evacuees flown from Wuhan arrived in Darwin on Sunday afternoon   Foreign Minister Marise Payne acknowledged it was a difficult situation for affected families.   'The children remain with family and are being well cared for,' she told Fairfax.   Among the Australians still stuck in Wuhan desperate to return home are Lily and her two teenage children.   'One
 is in grade 12 and the other in grade 8. If we can't go back to 
Australia by April, [the elder one] will have to re-study at grade 12,' 
she told the  Sydney Morning Herald .   'The
 children are very anxious, hoping to return to school as soon as 
possible. We are currently in good health, but we are worried about 
being infected.'      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "
1442967171,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/11/WS5e42062fa3101282172768ee.html,2020-02-11,Scientists say number of climate disasters could double in 13 years," Anyone who doubted the impact climate change is having on the 
environment only has to look at Australia and the bushfires that have 
scorched large parts of the country in recent months for proof that we 
have a problem.   Adding weight to the calls for urgent climate action are the findings
 of a new study, Impacts of Carbon Dioxide Emissions on Global Intense 
Hydrometeorological Disasters, published in the Climate, Disaster and 
Development Journal.   Focused on extreme flood and storm events over 46 years, the research
 directly connects the build-up of carbon emissions to the increase in 
the devastating floods and storms we are seeing today.   The study warns that the number of climate disasters could double in 
13 years, and ""severely damage the environment, socioeconomic progress, 
and welfare of millions of people worldwide"". Its findings make a strong
 and urgent case for implementing climate change mitigation and 
adaptation measures.   Although the Jan 23 study focuses on just two impacts of 
climate-flooding and storms such as hurricanes and typhoonsi 1/4 it is one 
more ""piece of evidence"" showing just how serious climate change has 
become, the lead author of the study, Ramon Lopez, said.   ""There is little time left to avoid even worse catastrophes for the 
ensuing decades than the ones that we are now predicting for the next 
decade,"" said Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile, in 
Santiago, who has spent much of his academic life examining the economic
 impact of climate change.   He said the time has now come to end the global political debate and 
promises of policy changes. ""What we need now is real action, especially
 by the big polluters,"" Lopez said.   ""Short of massive social pressure, governments are not going to do 
much more than make promisesi 1/4 and while social awareness is rising, 
effective pressures on politicians that we now observe are just not 
enough.   ""Some leaders simply do not see the need for action, and others are 
just too much concerned about the short run and lack the courage"" to 
implement the needed climate action measures, he said.   Don Clifton, with the School of Management at the University of South
 Australia, agrees. ""I don't expect those in the current (Australian) 
government who deny the human link with global warming will change their
 minds,"" he said.   ""For them it is not a matter of science; it's an ideological issue. No amount of scientific evidence will change this.""    High costs    Lopez said the cost in terms of human lives, and quality of life, for
 the people who are and will be affected by flooding and storms will be 
high.   ""The economic cost alone of relocating entire cities or building the 
necessary infrastructure to protect against flooding is huge,"" he said.   As an example, he cited Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New 
Orleans, in the United States, in 2005. ""The cost of partially 
protecting the city against another Katrina has been $25 billion so 
far,"" he said.   Vinod Thomas, a former senior vice-president with the World Bank, who
 co-authored the study, said if carbon emissions continue to rise at the
 current rate ""we can expect to see more intense storms and floods"".   Thomas, who also worked for the Asian Development Bank and is now a 
visiting professor with the Asian Institute of Management in Manila in 
the Philippines, said: ""It is quite obvious from the collapse of the UN 
Climate Change Conference (COP 25)"" in Madrid in December that 
policymakers ""show no urgency to reverse climate change"".   The study used climate data from 155 countriesi 1/4 taken from 1970 to 
2016i 1/4 and a statistical and econometric approach, rather than climate 
models, to assess the factors that have contributed to the increase in 
the frequency of intense flood and storm events.   ""The findings show that in addition to socioeconomic factors, the 
continuous increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the past 
four decades is significantly correlated with the increase in the number
 of extreme flood and storm events,"" said Thomas.   ""That means human actions have a decisive role in climate change. The
 results show that global climate conditions significantly affect the 
frequency of these disasters.""   The results of the study suggest that if the CO2 level increases by 1
 percent, floods and storms would increase by nearly 9 percent.   David Holmes, director of the Monash Climate Change Communication 
Research Hub at Melbourne's Monash University, said the recent bushfires
 in Australia are ""not just about cyclical drought, ...but about the 
fact that southern and inland areas of Australia are becoming much drier
 in a way that is overwhelming typical variability"".   ""In the last 15 years, Australia saw eight of its 10 warmest years on
 record. Climate scientists tell us that, with climate change, weather 
systems increasingly move poleward,"" he said.   ""This means that storm tracks that once brought moisture from the 
Southern Ocean right up the east coast are not reaching as far, and 
inland and forested areas are becoming much drier.""  "

Australia's
 Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy, said that despite 15 people
 in the country contracting the disease, they were all in 'good 
condition'.   After the outbreak of the disease in the Chinese city 
of Wuhan, many Australians rushed to buy protective facemasks in a 
desperate attempt to avoid the virus that has killed more than 1,000 
people.   Australians have been told to leave the face masks behind as health experts say there is no threat from the deadly coronavirus   Speaking to reporters in Canberra on Tuesday, Dr Murphy said that five people with coronavirus had recovered.   'There
 is no community transmission of this virus in Australia. We have not 
seen any case of sustained transmission at all in this country. There is
 no reason for people to be wearing masks,' he said.   Dr Murphy also stressed about racial profiling to people with Asian backgrounds.   'We are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling, which is completely abhorrent,' he said.   'There's no reason for people to avoid anybody of any particular background or appearance.   'We've
 still only got 15 cases in Australia, and all are clinically in good 
condition. They're all in stable condition. Five have recovered.'   Dr Murphy said all cases had been people who had come from China's Hubei Province or had been in contact with someone that had.   'I
 want to reassure the community. Our quarantine is working extremely 
well at the moment, and we're very, very pleased that the two facilities
 have had excellent medical support, and we're obviously actively 
screening everybody on a regular basis.'    The Chief Medical 
Officer said there may be cause for concern as the disease continues to 
spread, adding 'we're clearly getting growth every day'.    Australia's
 Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy, said despite 15 confirmed cases 
of coronavirus in the country, these people were in good condition   Fears
 have also emerged regarding Australians planning a trip to Bali as 
Indonesia is yet to report a single case of coronavirus.   Indonesia
 had direct flights from Wuhan in the early weeks of the outbreak and 
thousands of Australians travel to Bali every week.   A study by 
university researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health estimated that the number of cases should be much higher.   They suggested that due to the close proximity of Indonesia to the epicentre of the disease that more cases should appear.    Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison said he discussed the issue with 
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo and would work together to 
'contain the impact of the coronavirus between our two countries'.    Dr Murphy said Australia would continue to watch Indonesia to see if there are any cases confirmed.   'Obviously, it is somewhat surprising that there are no cases,' he said.   Thailand has 32 cases of coronavirus reported, Cambodia has one and Singapore has 43.    People

A mandatory quarantine period was then put on the ship by the Japanese government.   While
 many can disembark on February 19, those who came in close contact with
 confirmed coronavirus sufferers on board will have to wait until a 
fortnight since the interaction.     Four Australians are among the 135 passengers who have tested positive for the virus.

commits to renaming the menas competition AFLM?a This was the question I
 put to Nicole Livingstone, the head of womenas football, and Steve 
Hocking, head of football operations at the  AFL , on my ABC radio program, The Outer Sanctum, last weekend.   Predictably, many condemned the suggestion that the menas competition
 should be renamed. Some argued that we shouldnat mess with over 150 
years of tradition, seemingly forgetting that before the AFL was the 
AFL, it was the VFL, and before that, the VFA. Others argued a without 
further elucidation a that this was yet another case of apolitical 
correctness gone mada. A tired slogan all too often advanced without any
 attempt to explain it, the argument is supposed to be self-evident. Are
 we being told that any attempt to question the words we use and the 
meanings they make is an illness of mind, a kind of asicknessa, a 
pathology?    Other critics noted that the menas competition is the anorma, meaning
 that there is no need to distinguish it from the womenas. To do so 
would be an insult to the menas game, since we already know that aAFLa 
is synonymous with men. Proponents of the aMa are of course well aware 
of its normative status. This is precisely the problem they want us to 
reflect on.   Let me explain why so many footy fans have chosen this as their issue and why we are having this debate.   First and foremost a as the debate itself reminds us a language matters. Language does not simply  reflect  society but  shapes  it. These issues have been the subject of academic analysis by experts in semiotics and linguistics for decades.   Language reflects and reinforces meanings, shapes systems of thought 
and social norms, including the things we come to value and devalue. Our
 values and norms are shaped by the repetition of these words and the 
relations between them.    There are other ways that language has shaped and constrained how we 
come to think of women and it has long been dominated by words that 
position men as the default or norm. Words such as amankinda and 
amanmadea are used to denote humanity as a whole. They reinforce the 
notion that this is a world by, for and of men. Many of us who sit 
outside these norms feel our absence acutely, and frequently, in ways 
that those who occupy the dominant status may never notice, be aware of,
 or appreciate. To us, it matters.   Laws and other canonical documents often referenced only men, raising
 questions about whether women (and others, such as non-white men) 
existed in the eyes of the law at all. In some cases, the absence of 
references to women meant that they had no rights in law, and could not 
benefit from them. For those others, language  really  mattered, in a very real and tangible way.   These tendencies in language a to privilege men and erase or omit 
women a are pervasive, widespread, and continue to linger today. And one
 need not be excluded from legal rights to care about these omissions 
and erasures or to feel that our lives might be made just a bit better 
if our language was more deliberately inclusive.   The debate over AFLM cannot be separated from these histories and the
 injustices that language helps to perpetuate. It matters that the 
sportas governing body (the aAFLa) is wholly synonymous with the menas 
competition (the aAFLa) so that the menas competition remains the 
default, or norm.   What message does this send to women, men, boys and girls about the 
value placed on both women and womenas sport? It signals that we are 
lesser. This is repeated in every other aspect of the sportas 
governance: from inequalities in pay and resourcing, the shortened 
season, the difficult conditions under which many athletes compete, and 
the long fight to even get a womenas competition in the first place.   The subordinate status of  AFLW 
 is produced not just by historic inequities, differences in resourcing 
and pay inequities but by the continued positioning of womenas sport as 
an afterthought: a symbolic and literal aothera to the menas. If this 
weekas debate is anything to go by, many people think this is ajust a 
facta and prefer it to stay this way. But that is a backward-looking 
view; one which clings to old linguistic and structural patterns. It is a
 view that must change if the game is to grow, and if gender equality a 
in sport and society a is to ever become a reality.   When leading sports commentators dismiss the aMa debate as silly and 
meaningless, then, they demonstrate an ignorance of languageas 
constitutive power, the historic privileging of men as the norm and the 
force and significance of linguistic repetition.   It would be a small gesture to add an aMa. It wonat fix everything, 
but Iam not sure that anyone is claiming it will. For many of us, it 
would be a profound and meaningful step. One that will harm no-one, but 
mean a great deal to those of us so often on the outside. This includes 
future generations of girls, who do not yet know they are the aothera. 
Let us hope they never need to.    Associate Professor Kate Seear is a lawyer, and academic in

 is not a crime in almost half the countries in the world, a study of 
global laws said on Wednesday, urging nations to close legal loopholes 
that allow abusers to escape punishment.   Many states lack laws 
which directly criminalise and punish exerting ownership or control over
 another person, according to the Antislavery in Domestic Legislation 
database, launched at the United Nations headquarters in New York.   'Slavery
 is far from being illegal everywhere and we hope our research will move
 the conversation beyond this popular myth,' said Katarina Schwarz, a 
researcher at the University of Nottingham's Rights Lab, which led work 
on the slavery database.   Slavery is not a crime in almost half the countries in the world, a study of global laws said on Wednesday (file picture)   'It
 will surprise many people to learn that in all of these countries there
 are no criminal laws in place to prosecute, convict and punish people 
for subjecting people to the most extreme forms of exploitation.'   More
 than 40 million people are held in modern slavery, which includes 
forced labor and forced marriage, according to estimates by the 
International Labour Organization and the anti-slavery group the Walk 
Free Foundation.   Ending modern slavery by 2030 was among the global goals adopted unanimously by members of the United Nations in 2015.   But
 although historic laws that once allowed slavery have been scrapped 
worldwide, researchers for the database found that many of the 193 U.N. 
member states have not gone on to explicitly criminalise slavery and 
other exploitation.   There is no criminal law against slavery in 94
 countries - almost half of U.N. states - said researchers at Rights 
Lab, which reviewed the study's findings with the Castan Centre for 
Human Rights at Monash University in Australia.   It found almost 
two thirds of countries apparently failed to criminalise any of the main
 four practices associated with slavery - serfdom, debt bondage, forced 
marriage, and child trafficking - except in the context of human 
trafficking.   Researchers noted that almost all countries had some form of domestic anti-trafficking legislation in place.   But
 loopholes mean exploitation may have to be prosecuted indirectly under 
related laws, and in some cases abusers may escape punishment for 
exploitation altogether, said Schwarz.   The report reflects the 
fact that understanding of slavery has expanded to include a wide range 
of exploitation and laws have not always caught up, said Jakub Sobik, a 
spokesman for the charity Anti-Slavery International.   But he said simply toughening legislation was not the answer.   'Slavery
 in its nature looks to exploit people who fall slightly outside the 
rule of law,' he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'There is a need 
for wide-ranging policies that address the wider context and systemic 
reasons why people are made vulnerable to being tricked and trapped and 
controlled by another person.'     Advertisement    "

 couple who sent their baby girl to China to escape the bushfire crisis 
are now desperately trying to bring her home after she became trapped in
 Hubei amid the coronavirus outbreak.   Eighteen-month-old Chloe 
Luo, from Canberra, has been stuck in the Chinese province since 
January, when her parents flew her out to stay with relatives.    The
 little girl was sent to stay with her grandmother in Suizhou, three 
hours from the city of Wuhan, after the Australian capital became 
blanketed by toxic bushfire smoke.   'I sent her alone, back to my 
country. I just felt like it was a good thing [to get out] of a bad 
environment,' her mum Yi Zhao told  9News .    Yi
 Zhao (left) and Yufei Luo (right) from Canberra, flew their 
18-month-old daughter Chloe to China last month, in a bid to keep her 
safe from the bushfires    Little Chloe now 
remains stranded in with grandmother in Suizhou, three hours from Wuhan,
 after the province was place on lockdown amid the deadly coronavirus 
outbreak   Chloe is now among the hundreds of Australians 
unable to return home after the government implemented a travel ban in a
 bid to stop the disease from spreading.      Ms Zhao
 and husband Yufei Luo say they now feel 'guilty' for sending her abroad
 and have spent the last few weeks worried sick over their young 
daughter.     'I just want to cuddle her, or kiss her,' the mum said tearfully.    The
 parents are now asking the government to help bring Chloe home, as she 
was unable to fly back on an evacuation flight alone.     So
 far, over 300 Australians have been evacuated from the epicentre of the
 disease following an emergency evacuation efforts via 
airplane.     However, Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced on Wednesday the government was not 'considering a third flight at this time.'   She also confirmed Chloe does not fall under those 'vulnerable' Australians who are being given priority.    The

 travellers who have recently left or passed through mainland China are 
currently banned from entering our shores. Pictured are visitors 
arriving in Brisbane before the ban was implemented.   'Our 
effort has been to try to keep families together where possible. What 
we've been able to do is to assist those Australians to leave Wuhan who 
are cleared for departure by Chinese travel authorities,' she said in a 
press conference.    'That does not include family members of 
Australian children who are Chinese nationals and who are not Australian
 permanent residents.'    Ms Payne suggested the best thing for
 Chloe would be to remain in the care of her family in China, until it 
is safe for her to travel home.      Earlier this week, 
Health Minister Greg Hunt warned the travel ban will likely be extended 
as the worldwide death toll surpassed 1,000.   'We expect it will continue. We're not putting a timeframe on it,' the minister told The Australian.   Mr Hunt added the government acted on the best medical advice to implement the ban.   'Ultimately,
 our job a| our responsibilAity, is to provide protection and national 
health security for the Australian people,' he said.    'They've been difficult decisAions but made on the basis of the medical advice and we'll implemenAt the medical advice.'   Australia
 currently has 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus while four Australians 
are among 65 newly-confirmed cases aboard the quarantined Diamond 
Princess cruise ship docked at Yokohama in Japan.    The 
federal government also admits the ban has taken a toll on the tourism 
industry, which is losing an estimated $1billion a week.   Qantas this week also enforced the temporary suspension of its two direct services to mainland China until March 28.

 has agreed to relax its internet restrictions, after lobbying from the 
higher education sector, so international students can study online 
while they are banned from Australia during the coronavirus outbreak.   Currently  more than 100,000 Chinese students ,
 who already have Australian student visas and were planning on 
commencing their studies this month, are stranded outside of Australia 
as a result of the  governmentas 14-day travel ban from mainland China .   On
 Wednesday, Australiaas Global Reputation Taskforce a an emergency 
council of universities and education providers a met with education 
minister Dan Tehan and trade minister Simon Birmingham to discuss how 
they could limit  the potential $8bn hit to the economy .   Phil
 Honeywood, the chair of the taskforce, told Guardian Australia the 
ministers had secured new pathways for online courses a which would let 
isolated students keep their Australian enrolments.   But he warned 
that a visa approval freeze means Australia could aabsolutely lose outa 
to competitors as Chinese students could easily ago down the roada and 
obtain student visas for the US, the UK or Canada instead.   The 
government has not yet announced if the travel ban will be extended by 
another fortnight, but education providers are anot optimistica and 
preparing for the worst.   Honeywood, who is also the head of the 
International Education Association of Australia, said internet 
restrictions would be lifted for students, so they could reach 
university portals for lecture recordings and slides, among other sites.   aThere
 have been challenges over many years with online learning into China 
but the Chinese government has acknowledged that a more effectual 
arrangement is appropriate because of the isolation,a he said.   aWeave
 been able to make good progress on online learning options into China. 
There have been really worthwhile negotiations with the Chinese embassy.
 A number of platforms have been agreed to to deliver online courses to 
students who are offshore still.   aNot all courses will be suited 
to online delivery. There will be issues with which units of study can 
be provided, for what period of time. [But] it is definitely a better 
situation than we were facing a couple of weeks ago.a   But the 
universities are concerned that new visa delays, combined with the 
travel ban, mean Australia could lose out to other countries.   New 
student visa approvals have been frozen by the department of home 
affairs since 1 February, even for students who have already been 
accepted by Australian universities.   Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge  confirmed to the Australian 
 that the department was anot finalising applications for individuals 
currently in mainland Chinaa due to aenhanced border measuresa.   International students  contributed $34bn to the Australian economy 
 last year. Australiaas main competitors for Chinese students, Canada, 
the US and the UK run on a different academic year, starting in 
September, meaning they are less disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak 
this year.   aThe issue we have got is visas allegedly bring processed but not approved,a Honeywood said.   aA
 bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. If youare a student, and you
 canat get an Australian student visa to travel, any time you can go 
down the road to the Canadian embassy or the US embassy and they are 
still happily approving visas.   aChinese students, even if they 
canat travel to Australia now, once they have been given a student visa 
to come and study in Australia, they can once the virus is contained.   aBut
 because no visas have been approved, they are thinking aHow long is 
this going on for? Even when the virus is contained, I canat come to 
Australia to study because of the whole visa process. Iall go to Canada 
and the UK and delay my start date.aa   Honeywood said education 
minister Tehan was working with immigration minister Tudge ato get some 
clarification about what might be possible in that visa approval spacea.   Meanwhile, individual universities are also offering alternate course schedules for affected students. Melbourneas  Monash University has already pushed back the start date 
 of its semester by a week, while the ANU in Canberra has announced a 
semester during the traditional winter break to allow Chinese students 
to catch up on courses.   Other universities, such as the University
 of New South Wales, have recently changed to a trimester system, and 
are encouraging students to defer their enrolment to the next trimester,
 which starts around the beginning of June.   Honeywood said the 
universities ahave to abide by the chief medical officeras 
determinationa on the length of the travel ban, but that Australiaas 
higher education sector was uniquely vulnerable to the delay.   aMore
 than other study destination country, we are caught by geographic 
location and the fact that our academic year starts at the start of the 
calendar year,a he said.   aWhereas our main competitors, like 
Canada, the US and UK, their academic year doesnat start until later, in
 September. They arenat faced with a large influx of Chinese students 
wanting to commence studies until later this year. Australia and New 
Zealand are in a particular set of circumstances which no other 
competitor study destinations have.a  "

between China and New Zealand.   Ms Botor told the deputy principal 
that they hadn't travelled to China and didn't travel on the airline 
after the Philippines restricted travel to Hong Kong where they would 
have transited.   The family swapped flights and flew Qantas which delayed their return to New Zealand until February 5.    'I took the kids to the GP.

 Derek Linington apologised to the families and said their decision was 
based on advise from the Ministry of Education.    'While we 
initially asked a family to self-isolate, based on our discussions with

advised the family that they are now able to return to school

The
 virus, now officially known as COVID-19, has now claimed 1310 deaths at
 its epicentre in the Chinese province of Hubei after 242 people died on
 Wednesday.    Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the 
government is seeking medical advice to decide whether the current 
travel ban until February 17 will be extended (pictured at Parliament 
house on Wednesday)   The 242 fatalities broke records for the
 most deaths in a single day and were more than double the figures 
recorded on Tuesday,  News.com.au  reports.       The province's health commission says 14,840 cases have been detected, taking the total to 48,206.   The
 China Daily reported on Thursday 1000 medical personnel had been flown 
to Wuhan to beef up efforts to tackle the virus' spread.     Given
 Australia's close economic ties with China, the virus - along with this
 summer's bushfires and a long-running drought - is having huge 
financial impact on the economy.   It may even see the government forgo its much-promised budget surplus.   The tourism industry is paying a heavy price from Australia's ban on Chinese travellers   The
 ramifications are particularly bad for Australia's university sector, 
which has 68,000 Chinese foreign students locked out because of the 
travel ban.   'The timing for Australia is unique as opposed to the 
US or Canada, because of course we are at the start of our (education) 
year, so the timing is probably the worst possible outcome,' Vicki 
Thomson, chief executive of the Group of Eight universities, told ABC 
radio.    Global credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's 
expects the virus outbreak will trim half a percentage point from 
economic growth in 2020.   But it said a short and temporary delay in balancing the federal budget is unlikely to strain Australia's creditworthiness.   Foreign
 travellers who have recently left or passed through mainland China are 
currently banned from entering our shores (visitors pictured arriving in
 Brisbane before the ban was implemented)   'We believe the 
Australian government remains committed to medium-term fiscal 
discipline,' the agency said in an analysis on Australia.   'If, 
however, the virus cannot be contained as we expect, or if other 
unforeseen events emerge within the next few months, then the economic 
impact could escalate, with more severe credit implications, 
particularly in relation to Australia's fiscal position.'   National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster says nobody knows how long the virus will last.   'If you say it is going to finish in a month or so then you hopefully get a short, pretty significant impact,' he said.   If that proves the case, there will probably be a small hit to growth in the March quarter of this year.   Australians
 evacuated from China's Wuhan city, the coronavirus epicentre, have been
 placed into quarantine centres (some pictured boarding a bus after 
arriving Christmas Island on February 6)   'We are not talking
 about a recession,' he said, although growth will still be half a 
percentage point weaker over the year than earlier hoped.   'The 
government can fire-up fiscal policy, I don't know whether it will, and 
at some stage the Reserve Bank will probably have to help a little bit 
as well.'   Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said Labor put forward a 
number of suggestions to lift growth before the bushfires and virus took
 hold - including infrastructure spending, incentives for business 
investment and an increase to Newstart.   'It has been very 
disappointing that the government, not only haven't picked up and run 
with any of those ideas, but also they haven't had any ideas or plans of
 their own,' Dr Chalmers told ABC radio.

Japanas
 health minister said a few categories of passengers could spend the 
remainder of the two-week quarantine ashore. The Montgomerys thought 
they qualified because they share a cabin without windows or a balcony 
and Mr. Montgomery, 68, has diabetes.   Their hopes were quickly 
dashed. The health ministeras statement, it turned out, had been 
ambiguous. The captain of the vessel, the Diamond Princess, announced 
narrower criteria for offshore quarantine: passengers 80 or older with 
underlying medical conditions or windowless cabins.   aLooks like weare not going anywhere,a said Ms. Montgomery, 67.   The misunderstanding punctuated what critics call  Japanas bungled communications 
 during the crisis, reinforcing how the nation has been vexed by an 
epidemiological challenge that grows each day. With more and more of the
 Diamond Princess 3,400 anxious  passengers and crew getting sick a possibly infecting one another  a health officials have even raised the possibility of prolonging the quarantine, now set to expire next Wednesday.   Precisely
 how the coronavirus has been spreading aboard the ship is just one of 
many unknowns in the afflictionas reach into Japan. The country also 
announced its first death from the coronavirus, of a woman in her 80s in
 Kanagawa Prefecture, which includes Yokohama.   The authorities 
said the woman did not appear to have traveled to China, the center of 
the epidemic, before falling ill. Her death was the third so far outside
 mainland China; the others were in the Philippines and Hong Kong.   Japanas
 health ministry also announced 44 new coronavirus cases from the ship, 
raising the total to 218. Counting those from the vessel, total cases in
 Japan have surpassed 250, the most of any country other than China.   The
 clumsy messaging aside, the move by the health ministry to begin 
letting some people off the Diamond Princess was clearly a response to  mounting stress on board 
 as the quarantine slogs toward its planned conclusion in less than a 
week. The step also reflected the particular risk that the virus appears
 to pose to the elderly.   aPeople in the shipas 
surroundings are kind of in a cesspool of probability of being 
infected,a said Dr. Peter Katona, an infectious disease specialist at 
the University of California, Los Angeles.   aWe donat really 
understand the transmission of this virus very well,a he added. aSo I 
think that keeping people in their rooms and letting them out briefly is
 about as good as you are going to be able to do on a ship, but the 
psychological impact of that is hard to measure.a   The health 
minister, Katsunobu Kato, said the government would consider expanding 
the criteria to include passengers under 80 years old in the coming 
days.   According to a document distributed to
 several embassies by Japanas foreign ministry and seen by The New York 
Times, the Japanese government is discussing plans to administer 
coronavirus tests to people aboard the ship in tranches to determine if 
more can be quarantined onshore. Some passengers have been calling for 
testing of everyone on board, a step the government has called 
impractical.   Their psychological stress worsened on Thursday as 
the health ministry announced the new cases. The authorities have said 
that a small number of the 218 infected are in serious condition.   aI
 have worked hard to stay calm, but now itas getting so much harder,a 
Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif., said 
in a text message. aIt appears that we are put at risk daily by staying 
on the ship.a   Some epidemiologists said it 
was possible that the bulk of the people receiving diagnoses now had 
contracted the virus before the quarantine began on Feb. 4. The outbreak
 has been traced to a man who disembarked from the ship on Jan. 25 in 
Hong Kong and later tested positive.   For more than a week after 
his departure, passengers shared buffets, sat close to each other in 
theater performances and played mahjong on deck.   aThe curve youare
 seeing is a natural epidemiological wave,a said Dr. Allen Cheng, an 
infectious disease specialist at Monash University in Melbourne, 
Australia. aThe first person may have infected a number of people, and 
those secondary cases have caused tertiary cases, and what weare seeing 
now is the natural incubation of those tertiary cases.a   With crew 
members living and eating in close quarters, the chances for new 
infections rises the longer everyone stays on the ship. The danger was 
underlined on Wednesday when the health ministry announced that one of 
its own officials had been infected after helping to evaluate passengers
 and crew members for symptoms. The official had been wearing a mask and
 gloves but not a hazardous materials suit.   aThere is a 
possibility that infections have spread despite the fact that passengers
 have been isolated on board,a said Mitsuyoshi Urashima, a professor of 
molecular epidemiology at Jikei University Hospital in Tokyo. aItas 
better to let them off, as we donat know the cause of infection at this 
stage.a   Passengers were growing concerned that 
the longer they stayed on board, the longer the quarantine could be 
extended for passengers who are potentially exposed to confirmed 
infections.   aThe logic and the basis for the 
quarantine is that if people do not have a fever or show signs of 
sickness after 14 days, that they donat have the virus,a Mr. Montgomery,
 the passenger, said. aBut the problem is, on this petri dish of a ship,
 is that three days prior to the 19th, we may have an interaction with 
somebody in the hallway or on the decka who is infected.   On 
Wednesday, he said, when the couple went out for a prescribed fresh air 
break, another passenger was coughing in the hallway as they returned to
 their cabin.   aSo this whole thing is based on a false logic,a he said.   In
 a briefing earlier this week, Masami Sakoi, a health ministry official,
 said it was possible that people exposed to infected passengers would 
have to effectively reset the clocks on their quarantine periods.   Ms.
 Montgomery suggested that the governments of the countries with 
passengers or crew members on the Diamond Princess should offer to house
 people in quarantine facilities on land.   aIf the U.S. embassy 
took the Americans off and took us away from here and quarantined and 
tested us and they did that with every nationality, I think that would 
be more effective,a she said.   Even so, finding space where such a 
large number of people could be safely isolated and given proper medical
 care could be a challenge, especially as Japan is now seeing fresh 
cases elsewhere. On Thursday, the health ministry announced three new 
cases, involving a taxi driver and a doctor, in addition to the death 
from the coronavirus.   aWith those waves of new 
infections every day, that would challenge the most resilient personas 
sense of security,a said Benjamin Cowie, an infectious disease physician
 at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne.
 aBut thatas a very substantial number of people to then try to have to 
quarantine anywhere on the shore.a   Even with the 
rising stress, some passengers were making the best of their time 
trapped on board. Aun Na Tan, 43, an administrator from Australia who is
 sharing a windowless cabin with her husband, 44, and two teenage 
children, said they were playing card games and watching movies together
 while her husband works remotely and her children keep up with homework
 online.   In such close quarters, Ms. Tan said, amy daughter hops 
into my bed for a cuddle every now and then. Iam just enjoying the 
opportunity. They get less and less as she gets older.a   Even some who might be eligible to quarantine off shore said they would stick it out on the ship.   aLuckily,
 weare staying in a stateroom thatas slightly larger, so weare fine with
 it,a said Masako Ishida, 61, who is traveling with her mother and 
stepfather, who are in their 80s. aWe wouldnat mind at all if weare the 
last ones to disembark, as long as those in need can leave the ship. It 
would be easier if we stayed here until the 19th and relax.a   Reporting was contributed by Eimi Yamamitsu, Hisako Ueno, Makiko Inoue and Ben Dooley.   Updated March 24, 2020   It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, 
 especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen 
can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are 
coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a 
contaminated surface and then touch our face.   No.  The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. 
 Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but 
even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be 
available for 12 to18 months.   Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. 
 It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still 
uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions a
 not just those with respiratory diseases a particularly hard.    If youave been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, 
 and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call
 a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, 
how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially
 infecting or exposing others.   If youare sick and you think youave been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.  They
 will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that thereas a 
chance a because of a lack of testing kits or because youare 
asymptomatic, for instance a you wonat be able to get tested.   If the family member doesnat need hospitalization and
 can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs 
and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as 
possible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. 
 If thereas space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room
 and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick 
person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the 
room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to 
regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. 
Donat forget to wash your hands frequently.   Experts  are divided on how much protection a regular surgical mask, or even a scarf, can provide 
 for people who arenat yet sick. The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless 
youare already sick, or caring for someone who is, wearing a face mask 
isnat necessary.  And stockpiling high-grade N95 masks will make it 
harder for nurses and other workers to access the resources they need. 
But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of 
asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic. And a
 few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded 
places where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people. 
Masks donat replace hand-washing and social distancing.   Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong.  And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.   Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who donat live in your home.  Even
 if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, 
getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.     Thatas not a good idea. 
 Even if youare retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds
 so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense.
 But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a
 yearas worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next 
five years.   Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions a donat! 
 If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure 
youare at least saving as much as you can to get that afree money.a  "

 Australian racehorse trainer in Wuhan has the described the city as 
'out of this world' as it continues to grapple with the deadly  coronavirus  outbreak.    Rui
 Severino, who is working at the Yulong Jockey Club in Wuhan, said 
rapidly increasing cases of the deadly virus was taking a toll on the 
local community.    There have now been more than 1,300 
casualties, including 242 people who died in Hubei province, of which 
Wuhan is the capital, on the same day.   Nearly 15,000 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total to about 50,000 on mainland  China .   The father-of-two told  The Herald Sun  increased screenings may explain the rapid rise in confirmed cases.   Australian racehorse trainer Rui Severino is working in Wuhan during the coronavirus outbreak   Mr
 Severino said many preventative measures are in place to stop the 
spread of the deadly disease, including being tested twice a day, 
wearing face masks and remaining indoors   'Theyave been 
screening every single person that lives in Wuhan and in the province of
 Hubei, and Iam talking in the city of Wuhan 11 million people and they 
go to everyoneas house, every single house, every single person gets 
screened and I believe thatas why weare seeing these new cases,' Mr 
Severino said.    Mr Severino is still working with horses 
despite the outbreak, and is tested twice every day for the disease, 
with extreme preventative measures in place throughout the city.   Face
 masks are worn by everyone, and the usually crowded streets are bare, 
with each family of four only able to send one person out for two hours 
every two days for food.     'You might see one person, 
two people, and everyone sort of looks sideways to each other and if 
youare in the stores to buy groceries everyone keeps their distance from
 each other. Itas out of this world,' Mr Severino said.    Mr
 Severino was offered to come home by the Australian embassy, but chose 
to stay and work at the jockey club despite the disease   Mr 
Severino was last in Australia over the Christmas period with his sons 
in Melbourne, and landed back in Wuhan before the outbreak.   He has chosen to stay in Wuhan and work with his staff despite offers from the Australian embassy to bring him home.    Mr
 Severino said locals are confident the Chinese government will be able 
to control the coronavirus, and were diligently following their 
guidance.    'Physically itas not apocalyptic a thereas no 
armed guards on the street, thereas no people following around a but 
psychologically itas very, very surreal,' he said.   Mr 
Severino said locals believe the Chinese government will be able to

 Australians are the most prone to health risks caused by climate 
change, a group of doctors will tell federal politicians.   The 
National Rural Health Alliance will descend on Canberra to host a 
breakfast event at Parliament House on Thursday where its members will 
tell MPs about the impact extreme weather events will have on rural 
communities.   Chief of the alliance Gabrielle O'Kane says the impacts of climate change on rural Australians are significant and diverse.   ""There's
 the obvious fact that rural Australia is more susceptible to extreme 
weather events, but then there's the impact on things like food security
 as well as water quality and availability,"" Dr O'Kane said.   ""And
 let's not forget that climate change is a risk multiplier and can 
worsen already substantial social and health inequalities between those 
in rural communities and their city counterparts.""   Speakers at 
the event will include Monash University's Sustainable Development 
Institute director Anthony Capon, as well as rural GP and University of 
Newcastle director of rural health Jenny May.   The event comes as climate and energy politics stoke divisions in both the government and Labor.     Advertisement    "

 pulmonary function tests are measured at the mouth, these tests are 
unable to localise where in the lung any change in function originates,""
 researcher Dr Rhiannon Murrie said.   ""Additionally, CT scans 
cannot image the lung while it is breathing, which means airflow through
 the airways and into the lung tissue cannot be measured.""   The

 the onset of the deadly flu-like illness, China was Australia's biggest
 source of international tourists with 1.458million visiting in the year

Australia's biggest trading partner, is also the No.1 source of

 chief executive Anna Bligh, a former Queensland Labor premier, urged 
struggling business borrowers to ask their bank to allow them to 
refinance or defer their loan repayments.   'Thousands of businesses have had a horror start to the year with drought, bushfires and floods,' she said today.   'Now the coronavirus having a severe impact on both their ability to create products and also export them to markets overseas.   'Banks
 have hardship teams in place to walk businesses through the assistance

group was a sign the economy was in danger of sinking into a technical 
recession, as spending from China dried up.   'That's a sign that this is already starting to hit,' he said.    'I

mortgage crisis a decade ago.    'The coronavirus could be a 
big, external shock so essentially, if that goes really badly then it 
could be the sort of trigger that would create a GFC Mark II,' he said.   'I don't think Australia would be immune partly because we're so leveraged from a banking perspective.'   With

She was separated from her family and placed into quarantine after contracting the virus.    Ms
 D'Silva said she started feeling ill while all passengers were cooped 
up in their cabins for a week during the outbreak.     'I got a lot of headaches initially, when I was told we were quarantined, I started feeling hot with a fever,' she said.   'But other than that I feel fine a| it just feels like I have a cold.'   The
 disease is believed to have emerged in a market in Wuhan that sold wild
 animals, spreading rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year 
holiday in late January.    The virus has so far spread to more
 than 20 countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a
 global health emergency.    Paramedics were called to the
 international passenger terminal at Circular Quay shortly before 7.30am
 on Friday as the ship, the Norwegian Jewel docked    Saturday
 will mark two weeks since Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a 
temporary 14 day ban on foreign travellers who have left or passed 
through mainland China from arriving on our shores.   Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned the travel ban will likely be extended as the worldwide death toll surges towards 1000.   Mr Hunt added the government acted on the best medical advice to implement the ban.   'Ultimately,
 our job a| our responsibilAity, is to provide protection and national 
health security for the Australian people,' he said.   'They've been difficult decisAions but made on the basis of the medical advice and we'll implemenAt the medical advice.'   The Government admits the ban has taken a toll on the tourism industry, which is losing an estimated $1billion a week.

The former prime minister criticised the government's treatment of  coronavirus  evacuees in a scathing attack on ABC's Afternoon Briefing.     Mr Rudd weighed in on the issue as hundreds of Australians remain quarantined on the island - historically used as an  immigration  detention centre.    He
 admitted to being wary of policies proposed by Home Affairs Minister Mr
 Dutton, who he said had a 'long history' of dealing with race-related 
issues with 'less than appropriate sensitivity'.   Kevin Rudd
 has slammed Peter Dutton's decision to send Wuhan evacuees to Christmas
 Island, suggesting the home affairs minister would have treated them 
differently if they were 'white'   'I supposed the question 
I'd like to hear Mr Dutton answer, is simply this: If the dual-nationals
 we were rescuing from this virus happened to be Brits or happened to be
 Americans, would he be so quick to lodge them on Christmas Island and 
to mining camps outside of Darwin? I don't think so,' he said.    'The
 bottom line is you could secure quarantine facilities in a range of 
other places closer to civilisation in Australia, so I'm always 
concerned when Mr Dutton puts his hands to these questions.'    Mr
 Rudd said if he were still prime minister he would happily comply with 
the advice of health authorities, but questioned whether the government 
had been presented with other options.   'I would love to see 
publicly released the menu of options handed to Mr Dutton from the 
medical authorities outlining where these folks could've been 
quarantined.   'I would like to see the menu of options and why Mr 
Dutton chose these two particular options, and what he would have done 
had we been dealing with white people with a virus as well.    'I'll leave that and I look forward to his answer at some stage.'   Australian
 nationals who were among the Wuhan evacuees walk inside the Australian 
Immigration Detention Centre on Christmas Island, last week    Mr
 Rudd said he would like to see the options that were presented to the 
government for quarantining evacuees and why Mr Dutton chose Christmas 
Island    Mr Rudd went on to slam the government's alleged lack of  support
 for China in the wake of the outbreak, despite happily 
taking billions of dollars in export revenue from visiting 
tourists.      'So far, we've seen very few 
expressions of genuine solidarity, sympathy and support, from the 
Australian government to the Chinese people because first and foremost 
whatever we think of China's political ideology this is a humanitarian 
crisis of massive proportions.'      Mr Rudd's 
comments come after the Chinese embassy in Australia criticised the 
federal government's 'extreme' decision to extend a coronavirus-related 
travel ban for another week.   From Friday, foreign nationals who 
have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 
14 days from the time they left.   'We did not take this decision lightly,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.   'We
 are very mindful of the disruption and economic impacts of these 
arrangements, but I note Australia is one of 58 countries that has 
introduced some form of travel restrictions.'   But the Chinese 
embassy said the ban should be lifted, saying the World Health 
Organisation didn't recommend travel or trade restrictions on China.   'We express our deep regret and dissatisfaction over the Australian government's announcement,' a spokesman said in a statement.   'Only Australia and a small number of countries have taken such extreme measures which are an overreaction indeed.'   Australian
 citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will 
their immediate family members, but they must self-isolate for 14 days 
from the time they left mainland China.   The restrictions will be reviewed in one week.   Mr
 Rudd weighed in on the issue as hundreds of Australians remain 
quarantined on the island - historically used as an immigration 
detention centre   Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan 
Murphy said the key concern was the spread of the virus, officially 
known as COVID-19, across China.   There are now more than 60,000 
confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the province of Hubei 
where it was first detected, and 1357 people have died.   More than 
240 deaths were reported on Wednesday alone, the highest number of 
fatalities on a single day since the virus was first reported in 
December.   Of the 15 cases in Australia, six have been cleared and the remaining nine are all stable.   No
 quarantined Australians at Christmas Island and Darwin have tested 
positive for the virus, with the first group of evacuees due to return 
home on Monday.   Universities are contacting their Chinese students
 to ensure they understand how the extension of travel restrictions 
affect them and to provide support.   Work is underway on extending 
existing domestic tourism campaigns to help businesses impacted by the 
downturn in foreign visitors.   An Australian public health expert 
is being sent to Japan to look at the handling of the cruise ship 
Diamond Princess' quarantine process and provide advice to the 
government.   More than 200 Australians are passengers on the ship, with 11 of them testing positive for the virus.

 law student's parents Suzanne (centre) and Delonne D'Silva (right) have
 now also caught coronavirus and have both developed pneumonia, making 
them short of breath   On Saturday night, the Australian 
government sent an infectious disease expert to Yokohama to judge 
whether to evacuate some or all of the 200 passengers.   Australia's
 deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said there were 'particular 
risks' for the elderly people aboard the Diamond Princess.    'We
 wait for our expert to be on the ground to assess what is the best 
option for those Australians ... this has been a difficult situation to 
be stuck on that ship for so long and we certainly want to make the best
 options available to our citizens,' Mr Kelly told the  Sydney Morning Herald .     'We
 will be looking at the health and welfare of that group and what might 
be best done with a view to getting them off the ship.'    If evacuated, the passengers would be quarantined for two weeks once back on Australian shores.   Australia
 would be following the path of the US, which is already preparing to 
evacuate its citizens aboard the Diamond Princess this 
weekend.     Speaking to the  Herald Sun , Ms D'Silva said her condition is not as severe as her parents since she is younger.    'I
 am just worried for mum and dad. They are getting it a bit worse 
because they are older than me. We are just taking it a day at a 
time,' she told the publication.    Ms D'Silva had planned to 
have a birthday party in Melbourne for her 21st birthday but instead 
celebrated by eating pizza alone in her hospital room.    The 
law student said she has been keeping busy by responding to worried 
messages from friends and family and will have an even bigger party when
 she returns home.    Japanese hospital staff ordered two 
pizzas to celebrate Bianca's 21st on Saturday but after the parents 
wished their daughter happy birthday, everyone had to go back to their 
own separate hospital rooms to eat alone.    Ms D'Silva and her parents are  forced to be confined to a wheelchair with a portable inside a plastic box when they are transported around the hospital.     Ms
 D'Silva said said she is 'worried' about her parents. 'They are getting
 it a bit worse because they are older than me. We are just taking it a

daughter a happy 21st birthday, they immediately had to go back to their
 own separate hospital rooms to eat pizza alone   Each member 
of the D'Silva family has varying degrees of illness with father Delonne
 the worst hit, having been prescribed a course of medication to combat 
the illness.   Mr D'Silva's wife Suzanne said coronavirus is an 
unpredictable disease and can often get worse after showing signs of 
improvement.     'He (Mr D'Silva) is a pretty strong man 
so when he gets sick it's pretty bad. It has just been one nightmare 
after another,' Mrs D'Silva told the Herald Sun.    'Even a nightmare is not as bad as this. Just when you think you are OK something happens. It's all up and down.'     Mrs
 D'Silva said her 14-year-old son Brenton is okay, although he has 
been isolated from his parents and sister for a number of days.    The teenager has been keeping himself busy by playing video games on his portable Nintendo Switch console.    The

 authorities say the testing of passengers will be a 'safeguard' and 
doesn't reflect any concern around potential outbreaks aboard the

however, as a safeguard, any unwell passengers will be assessed by 
health teams here,' New South Wales Health said.   The testing process will be similar to the assessments being done for passengers arriving at Sydney airport.   New
 South Wales Health said thousands of passengers, including the elderly,
 are often on cruise ships and they often require medical management for
 unrelated infectious diseases while on the cruise or when they 
disembark.   The announcement comes  after a passenger aboard the Norwegian Jewel was tested and cleared of coronavirus on Friday.      The
 ship's owner slammed 'false and inflammatory' media reports which 
suggested someone on board could have contracted the disease.     The
 announcement comes after a passenger aboard the Norwegian Jewel

 ship, which arrived in Sydney on Friday and was scheduled to depart on 
Saturday for a 14-day cruise of Australia and New Zealand, was never 
locked down.     New South Wales health confirmed the female in her 50s was being tested as precaution.   At
 the time reports emerged the passenger had been suffering after 
from respiratory illness but the cruise company said a few passengers 
had been suffering from stomach related illnesses.   A spokeswoman 
for the cruise company said  they had 'stringent sanitation 
procedures' to mitigate any impact of this rare occurrence.'   'As such a thorough inspection and rigorous cleaning and disinfection of the ship and terminal were conducted.'   Australia
 currently has 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus while 11 Australians 
are among 65 newly-confirmed cases aboard the quarantined Diamond

 D'Silva said she started feeling ill while all passengers were cooped 
up in their cabins for a week during the outbreak.     'I got a lot of headaches initially, when I was told we were quarantined, I started feeling hot with a fever,' she said.   'But other than that I feel fine a| it just feels like I have a cold.'   The
 disease is believed to have emerged in a market in Wuhan that sold wild
 animals, spreading rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year 
holiday in late January.    The virus has so far spread to more
 than 20 countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a
 global health emergency.    Paramedics were called to the
 international passenger terminal at Circular Quay shortly before 7.30am

 will mark two weeks since Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a 
temporary 14 day ban on foreign travellers who have left or passed 
through mainland China from arriving on our shores.   Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned the travel ban will likely be extended as the worldwide death toll surges towards 1000.   Mr Hunt added the government acted on the best medical advice to implement the ban.   'Ultimately,
 our job a| our responsibilAity, is to provide protection and national 
health security for the Australian people,' he said.   'They've been difficult decisAions but made on the basis of the medical advice and we'll implemenAt the medical advice.'

So
 far, the disease has killed over 1,600 people and infected about 70,000
 people globally, including 15 people in Australia.    The 
epicentre of the virus, Wuhan, remains almost entirely cut off from the 
outside world as authorities try to halt its spread.    Daily Mail Australia spoke with Australians who are currently stuck in Shanghai, some 1,000kms away from Wuhan.   Despite
 the distance between the cities, the virus has had detrimental impacts 
across the entire country, leaving people confined to their apartments 
and unable to eat out or attend work or send their children to school.   The
 usually busy streets of Shanghai are basically deserted at the moment, 
as people remain indoors due to the rapid spread of coronavirus   Pictured: Danny Chen in his mask   Danny
 Chen, an Australian-born Chinese man working as an online stock trader 
in Shanghai, said at first he didn't appreciate the significance of the 
virus.   'At first it felt like the virus was a thorn in our side 
where we just had to take some precautions, but now it feels like our 
life revolves around it [the virus],' he said.   Mr Chen moved to China to care for his 97-year-old grandmother, who is suffering from late stage breast cancer.   He knows he won't be returning to Australia any time soon, despite safety concerns.    'I
 need to go to the hospital to fetch medicine for my grandma every few 
weeks and I also don't want to unknowingly bring an infection back to my
 parents in Australia and put them at risk,' he said.   'My life in 
Shanghai today is completely different to my life a month ago. Daily 
life is disrupted across all levels both directly and indirectly.'   Mr Chen keeps all outdoor activity to a minimum.   But when he does go out, there is now a long list of steps he ticks off before opening the front door.    'When
 I do go out I have to make a lot more preparations. I bring only my 
phone, I wear my face mask, my gloves, a few layers of clothing to 
ensure no skin exposure and my hoodie to cover my head,' he said.    'When
 I return, I have to thoroughly disinfect everything and wash whatever I
 was wearing right away. It's an annoying process, and something I have 
go through even if I'm just throwing out the garbage downstairs.    'All avenues of outdoor entertainment are no longer possible and eating out is not advised.'    In
 addition to the potential social and health implications, 
Shanghai-based Australian photographer and writer Dave Tacon said the 
financial blow of the quarantine has been - and will continue to be - 
devastating.    Shanghai-based Australian photographer 
and writer Dave Tacon (pictured) said the financial blow of the 
quarantine has been devastating   Pictured: Food covered up in a mostly empty Shanghai market as people remain indoors for their own safety   'A
 lot of my work is commercial photography and video production. This 
work has completely evaporated along with a few client meetings I had 
lined up,' he said.    'Besides international industry supply 
chains, the lock down here is impacting pretty much all aspects of the 
economy including small business owners.   'A lot of shops where I live in Shanghai remain closed and the restaurants that are open are practically empty.'   Mr
 Tacon knows of families who escaped to Bali or Thailand before entire 
provinces were placed into quarantine, but admits they won't be able to 
survive there long.   The food markets are mostly closed with only a few stalls open to sell the essentials   'Many of them must be thinking ''this is killing my business, I'm hemorrhaging money, when is this going to end?'',' he said.   The
 photographer could have returned home to Australia but opted against it
 when he learned his fiancee, who is a Chinese citizen, couldn't join 
him.     'We're catching up on movies and TV series and 
cooking at home. She was lucky to be able to return after Chinese New 
Year from her hometown in Zhejiang, which borders Shanghai and is one of
 the provinces worst hit after Hubei.    'She caught the last 
bus out not long after the first cases were discovered there. Her town 
is now effectively cut off from the rest of China.'    Pictured: Casey Hall wearing her mask as she steps out in her deserted street   Mother-of-three
 and fashion correspondent Casey Hall said the worst part of the 
experience for her family is that her children have been stuck indoors 
since January 24.    She said two of her three girls, aged five, three and one, have celebrated their birthdays since the lockdown began.    'The
 main thing is the kids not being able to go outside. They have not been
 at their kindergarten or preschool since January 24 and we've been 
given no guidance as to how long they will be home for.    'Their
 outings are basically a trip to the fruit shop, but they have to wear a
 mask and, for the baby especially, that's pretty impractical.'   When
 they return home to their apartment building, officials check their 
temperature to make sure they're not running a fever, which is a 
telltale sign of the coronavirus.    'It's difficult to be living in limbo, not knowing when it's going to end.'     Hugh Bohane is an Australian freelance journalist covering Asia.

 quarantine for its citizens who are evacuated from the ship, with a 
decision to be made later Monday.   The number of infected passengers continues to grow, with an additional 70 cases reported on Monday, taking the total to 356.   Frustration

 vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available 
data a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.    Pneumonia
 is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill 
with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.      Those who choose not to board the chartered flight will have to stay in Japan for two weeks before heading home.   Australians on board the 'nightmare ship' are still waiting for the Morrison government to decide on a plan.   The
 government is awaiting a report from an Australian infectious disease 
expert who is in Japan assessing the situation on board the ship.   Federal cabinet minister Dan Tehan said the expert's report would be finalised on Monday.    Mr
 Tehan said the government would consider placing the evacuees in 
quarantine on Australian soil despite the cruise ship passengers having 
long been in lockdown.   'If they did have to go to quarantine there would be a facility available where they could go for two weeks,' he said.   'We
 will take the guidance from the chief medical officer as to what's the 
best available action to take to keep Australians safe.'   The 
Australians on board must pass a coronavirus test before they can be 
brought home, and elderly people will be given priority in the 
evacuation.   An additional 70 people on board the quarantined ship

 a The ground rules were clear. A day before 328 Americans were to be 
whisked away from a contaminated cruise ship in Japan, the U.S. Embassy 
in Tokyo told passengers that no one infected with the  coronavirus  would be allowed to board charter flights to the United States.   But as  the evacuees 
 began filing onto two reconfigured cargo planes early Monday for 
departures to military bases in California or Texas, some noticed tented
 areas separated from the rest of the cabin.   Then reality hit: 
After 12 days stuck on the cruise ship where more and more people were 
testing positive for the virus, they were now sharing planes with people
 carrying the same pathogen they were desperate to escape.   aI 
didnat know until we were in the air,a said Carol Montgomery, 67, a 
retired administrative assistant from San Clemente, Calif. aI saw an 
area of plastic sheeting and tape.a   While 
the planes were aloft, the State Department and the Department of Health
 and Human Services said in a joint statement that the results for 14 
passengers who had been tested two or three days earlier had come back 
positive a just as they were heading to the airport in buses.   American
 officials, it turned out, had started bringing the passengers home 
without actually knowing their test results. But because the evacuation 
had already begun by the time Japanese officials relayed those results, 
officials decided to let the infected evacuees, who were not yet 
exhibiting symptoms, board the planes and sit in the back, separated 
from other passengers by plastic sheets about 10 feet tall.   The reversal was the latest chaotic turn in a two-week quarantine of the ship that has become an epidemiological nightmare.   Even
 as the Americans were flying home and countries like Australia, Canada 
and South Korea were preparing to evacuate their own citizens, the 
Japanese Health Ministry announced on Monday that 99 more cases had been
 confirmed on the cruise ship, bringing the total to 454.   Among 
them was the third Japanese public health official to contract the virus
 while tending to passengers and crew members aboard the ship, the 
Diamond Princess.   The unstinting rise in 
infections a and the scramble to bring American passengers home, even 
after some were discovered to be infected a has led to tough questions, 
and some withering criticism, about the handling of the outbreak aboard 
the ship, home to the largest number of coronavirus cases outside China.   aThe
 quarantine on the ship ended up being an unprecedented failure,a said 
Eiji Kusumi, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases at Navitas 
Clinic in Tokyo. aWe should learn from this lesson that a quarantine on a
 ship is impossible, and we should not repeat this in the future.a   Countries around the world are now struggling to figure out what to do with cruise ships during the coronavirus outbreak.   Another ship,  the Westerdam ,
 was turned away from port after port in Asia until it was welcomed in 
Cambodia. The cruise line insisted that no one was ill and passengers 
started heading home, yet one of them, an American woman, later tested 
positive for the virus, worrying experts that the epidemic will get only
 worse.   After the long quarantine in Japan, the U.S. authorities 
had strongly encouraged American passengers on the Diamond Princess to 
accept the offer of a flight out. Getting them off the ship took days of
 planning and hours of screening, checking passports and loading 
passengers onto buses for the 40-minute bus ride from the port of 
Yokohama to Haneda Airport in Tokyo.   The goal was
 to ensure that passengers who were symptomatic remain in Japan, 
American officials said. Medical experts examined American passengers on
 the ship and determined that at least 328 of them could be evacuated. 
Meanwhile, Japanese medical experts had done testing of the passengers, 
but did not have all the results ready .    In the end, 61 Americans remain on board, officials said.   Asked
 why American officials began evacuating passengers without knowing 
their test results, Dr. William Walters, managing director of 
operational medicine at the State Department, told reporters on Monday 
that it was aunpredictablea when the results would come back.   The 
Americans were put on about 15 buses to the airport. Once it became 
clear that some had the coronavirus, the State Department said, the 
infected passengers awere moved in the most expeditious and safe manner 
to a specialized containment areaa in the rear of the planes.   aIn the isolation area, they posed no additional risk,a Dr. Walters said.   After
 landing, the 14 infected evacuees went to hospitals for monitoring and 
treatment. Most ended up being flown to Omaha for medical treatment by 
experts at the University of Nebraska. Another five returning passengers
 were also put into isolation because they had developed fevers.   The
 remaining American passengers stayed at Travis Air Force Base in 
California or Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, where they had landed 
and where they will remain under quarantine for an additional 14 days.   When
 one of the planes landed in California, a line of officials from the 
military, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the 
Department of Homeland Security greeted passengers with banners that 
read aWelcome home.a   After being ushered through an isolation tent, they were assigned to apartments on the base.   aThey
 have flown in specialists from across the country,a said one evacuee, 
Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif. aItas a
 phenomenal amount of resources. Iam kind of blown away.a   Epidemiologists
 said American officials had made a difficult decision in allowing 
infected passengers onboard the charter flights.   aYou
 donat want to expose anyone on the plane who hadnat otherwise been 
exposed before on the boat,a said Dr. Allen Cheng, an infectious disease
 specialist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.   Australia
 is planning to take approximately 200 passengers off the Diamond 
Princess on Wednesday. Dr. Cheng said that Australia had decided that 
aanyone who is sick or becomes sick in the next 48 hours will stay in 
Japan and stay in the hospital.a   With Australia and other 
countries preparing to help transport their citizens off the boat, the 
captain told the more than 2,000 people still on board that the Japanese
 health authorities could swab everyone for the coronavirus by the end 
of Monday and begin letting guests leave the ship on Wednesday.   aThis
 disembarkation will be an ongoing processa until Feb. 22, the captain 
said in an onboard announcement. The captain said the cruise line was 
acoordinating closely with your embassies.a   In a briefing on 
Monday, Shigeru Omi, president of the Japan Community Healthcare 
Organization, said that Japan had made the right decision to put the 
ship in quarantine based on the information available when the ship 
arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 3. aAt that time, the international 
community was trying to contain the virus,a Mr. Omi said.   According
 to the Japanese Health Ministry, at least 71 Americans on the ship were
 infected with the coronavirus. Many of them remain in hospitals around 
Japan.   John Haering, 63, a retired operations 
manager for Union Pacific Railroad who lives in Tooele, Utah, was taken 
to a hospital in Chiba Prefecture last week with a fever and tested 
positive for the virus. He said he felt stranded as he lay in an 
isolation room.   His wife, Melanie, left on one of the charter flights.   aIam
 happy for her that she got out of here and that sheas going to get some
 attention in the U.S.,a said Mr. Haering, who retired in November and 
was about a third of the way through a six-month trip around the world. 
aBut at the same time Iam sad. You feel that loss of somebody leaving.a   Mr.
 Haering, who said that he no longer had any symptoms or a fever but 
that a CT scan showed signs of pneumonia, was not sure how much longer 
he would have to stay.   aThey did swab me today again, and Iall get
 my test back tomorrow,a he said. aI asked the doctor if the swab shows 
that Iam negative, and he just shook his head and said, aI donat know.a 
Thereas a lot of stuff that they donat know.a   Mr. Haering said he 
had not heard from anyone at Princess Cruises, the company that operates
 the Diamond Princess, since he arrived at the hospital. Until Sunday, 
he had not heard from anyone at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, either.   He
 received a call and a follow-up email urging him to get in touch with 
the cruise ship company for further information about how he will get 
home.   aItas very scary,a he said. aIt feels like a little bit of abandonment.a   Tung
 Pi Lee, 79, a retired physician, was left in a Tokyo hospital with a 
coronavirus infection while his wife, Angela, flew to California on one 
of the charter flights. Several of her siblings and their spouses were 
among the 14 infected passengers who flew home. Two were taken to 
Nebraska, and another was in California for treatment.   aI
 am glad for my aunts and uncles to be in the U.S. and to be receiving 
treatment here,a said JoAnn LaRoche Lee, one of Mr. Leeas daughters. 
aHad they been left in Japan, I wonder what would have happened to 
them.a   Trying to coordinate her fatheras care in Tokyo with her 
siblings in the United States, she said, afeels like a never-ending 
nightmare.a   Motoko Rick reported from Tokyo and Edward Wong from 
Philadelphia. Hisako Ueno, Eimi Yamamitsu and Makiko Inoue contributed 
reporting from Tokyo, and Chris Cameron from Washington.   Updated March 24, 2020   It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, 
 especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen 
can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are 
coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a 
contaminated surface and then touch our face.   No.  The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. 
 Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but 
even if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be 
available for 12 to18 months.   Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. 
 It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still 
uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions a
 not just those with respiratory diseases a particularly hard.    If youave been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, 
 and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call
 a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, 
how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially
 infecting or exposing others.   If youare sick and you think youave been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.  They
 will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that thereas a 
chance a because of a lack of testing kits or because youare 
asymptomatic, for instance a you wonat be able to get tested.   If the family member doesnat need hospitalization and
 can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs 
and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as 
possible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. 
 If thereas space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room
 and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick 
person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the 
room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to 
regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. 
Donat forget to wash your hands frequently.   Experts  are divided on how much protection a regular surgical mask, or even a scarf, can provide 
 for people who arenat yet sick. The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless 
youare already sick, or caring for someone who is, wearing a face mask 
isnat necessary.  And stockpiling high-grade N95 masks will make it 
harder for nurses and other workers to access the resources they need. 
But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of 
asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic. And a
 few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded 
places where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people. 
Masks donat replace hand-washing and social distancing.   Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong.  And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.   Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who donat live in your home.  Even
 if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, 
getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.     Thatas not a good idea. 
 Even if youare retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds
 so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense.
 But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a
 yearas worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next 
five years.   Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions a donat! 
 If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure 
youare at least saving as much as you can to get that afree money.a  "

Just
 104 Indonesians have been tested out of a population of 270 million, 
despite neighbouring countries including Australia reporting multiple 
cases.   Indonesia is yet to report a single confirmed case of the 
virus, which has spread across the globe in recent weeks with a death 
toll of more than 1700.   However, that clean bill of health may change within days following reports two men may have contracted the virus.   It
 was an emotional reunion for these women at Indonesian's Juanda 
International airport on Saturday after a student (wearing face mask) 
spent time in quarantine following the outbreak   Indonesian 
health minister Terawan Agus Putranto has since defended the country's 
handling of the outbreak and insists they remain on high alert with 
steps put in place to detect the coronavirus.   'We say prayers together that no coronavirus enters,' he told reporters on Monday.   'We continue to pray that God gives protection to our country.'   When
 quizzed about why so few tests had been conducted in the fourth 
most-populated country in the world, Putranto cited 'efficiency in 
budgeting'.   'We don't test everybody. You guys [reporters at the 
press conference] who are now wearing masks, would you like to be 
tested? We have to see someone's travel advisory. We have to be rational
 and efficient,' he said.    Worshippers at the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta pray their country remains free of the virus   The new coronavirus has killed at least 1,775 people and infected more than 71,440 globally   Like
 Australia, Indonesia has also shut down all flights to and from 
mainland China in response to virus fears and is conducting surveillance
 at 135 entry points across the country.   It comes after a US study
 by Harvard University public health researchers found Indonesia should 
be impacted by the coronavirus and could have undetected cases, citing 
its extensive air links to China and the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of
 the outbreak.   More than two million people visit Indonesia from China each year.   Despite
 no confirmed cases, Indonesia has steps in place to monitor and watch 
for signs of the virus. Pictured are health workers taking part in a 
simulation exercise in Denpasar   Nearly 1,800 people across the world have now died from the killer coronavirus, or COVID-19   The
 study's co-author described the possibility of Indonesia being free 
from the virus as 'statistically improbable'.     'If 
Indonesia was equally sensitive in detecting infected travellers as the 
high capacity countries [such as Singapore] in our statistical sample, 
then given the travel volume from Wuhan [to Indonesia], there is less 
than a 2.5 per cent chance they would have failed to detect any cases,' 
Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch told  Fairfax .   'At
 this stage focusing on travellers [who might be infected] is probably 
not the top priority. If there are cases in the country, it's more 
important they find them and stop them transmitting.'    More than 71,000 have caught the virus, including 454 on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan   Putranto slammed the study's findings and described the report as 'insulting' for Indonesia.    'The bottom line is that we're following international standards,' he told reporters last week.   'We're not hiding anything.'   Indonesian
 health minister Terawan Agus Putranto (pictured) has defended his 
country's handling of the outbreak. The island nation is yet to report

There have already been 15 cases of coronavirus in Australia since the lethal virus was discovered in  China  in December - and doctors fear the number will grow.   Professor
 Philip Booy, a senior fellow at the Immunisation Coalition, has warned 
the disease could become more widespread during flu season.    'Coronavirus
 and flu are both dangerous on their own, but we could have two viruses 
spreading at once,' he told Daily Mail Australia.   'We have to keep
 coronavirus under control because it can lead to respiratory 
infections. So far we have done that but we need to keep it up.'   Medical personnel scan a new coronavirus patient at a hospital in Wuhan, China on Sunday   Viruses
 spread faster and more widely in winter because the air is less humid 
and people spend more time in close contact indoors.    The 
death rate for coronavirus is estimated to be around 2 per cent while 
the figure for flu is about 0.5 per cent, according to  data  from the US.    In
 2019 Australia suffered an unusually severe flu season with more than 
310,000 patients, peaking in July when 70,000 lab-confirmed cases were 
recorded in a single month.   Professor Booy said this means that 2020 should be a relatively quiet year - but said 'we can never be sure'.   'Both
 last year and three years ago we had very big flu seasons. Because of 
last year being such a big season, many people have built up immunity.   'So my best guess is that we are in for a quiet to moderate season.'    Professor
 Booy, who trained as a pediatrician in Queensland before becoming a 
leading disease expert, said Australia should focus efforts on 
containing the coronavirus.    'The travel ban has been important and now we are trying to develop a vaccine,' he said.    This
 graph shows the number of cases of flu in the past few years. The 
purple line shows 2017 with its peak in August and the orange line shows
 2019 with its peak in July   This photo taken on 
February 14, shows a woman wearing a face mask walking past a charms 
shop in the Binondo district of Chinatown in Manila   On 
Tuesday Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will 
contribute $2million to help find a vaccine for the coronavirus, known 
as COVID-19.     Meanwhile, about 200 Australians on a 
coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan have been given the option to be 
evacuated to an unused workers site near Darwin on Wednesday.   The 
ship - which has had more than 450 cases confirmed, including at least 
16 Australians - has been quarantined at the port of Yokohama for more 
than two weeks.   But due to the number of recent cases on the ship,
 they would have to undergo another two-week quarantine period at the 
Howard Springs facility.   Mr Morrison sympathised with the 
Australians stuck on the ship, saying he understood they would be 
frustrated at the thought of another two weeks in quarantine.   'It's
 unfortunate but it is absolutely necessary to ensure that we put the 
measures in place that have been so effective in containing the spread 
of this virus,' he said.   The Australians on board must pass a 
coronavirus test before they can be brought home, and elderly people 
will be given priority in the evacuation.   Wednesday's flight will also include New Zealanders, who will be transferred home after landing in Darwin.   There have been 15 cases of COVID-19 in Australia, with eight people now recovered and the rest in a stable condition.   There are now more than 71,000 cases worldwide, with 1776 reported deaths.

1452227080,https://www.cnet.com/features/the-race-to-save-australias-iconic-species-from-extinction/,2020-02-18,The race to save Australia's iconic species from extinction," The road into Batlow is littered with the dead.   In
 the smoky, gray haze of the morning, it's hard to make out exactly what
 Matt Roberts' camera is capturing. Roberts, a photojournalist with the 
Australian Broadcasting Corporation, keeps his lens focused on the road 
as he rolls into the   fire-ravaged   town 55 miles west of Canberra, Australia's capital. At the asphalt's edge, blackened livestock carcasses lie motionless.   The grim scene,  widely shared on social media , is emblematic of the impact the 2019-20 bushfire season has had on Australia's animal life. Some estimates suggest  ""many, many billions"" of animals have been killed , populations of  endemic insects  could be crippled and, as ash washes into riverways,  marine life will be severely impacted . The scale of the bushfires is so massive, scientists are unlikely to know the impact on wildlife for many years.   But
 even before bushfires roared across the country, Australia's unique 
native animals were in a dire fight for survival. Habitat destruction, 
invasive species, hunting and climate change have conspired against 
them. Populations of native fauna are plummeting or disappearing 
altogether, leaving Australia with an unenviable record: It has the 
highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world.   A large share of 
Australia's extinctions have involved marsupials -- the class of mammals
 that includes the nation's iconic kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and 
wombats. A century ago, the   Tasmanian tiger  
 still padded quietly through Australia's forests. The desert 
rat-kangaroo hopped across the clay pans of the outback, sheltering from
 the sun in dug-out nests.   Now they're gone.   Australia's 2019-20 bushfire season has been devastating for wildlife.   In
 a search for answers to the extinction crisis, researchers are turning 
to one lesser-known species, small enough to fit in the palm of your 
hand: the fat-tailed dunnart. The carnivorous mouse-like marsupial, no 
bigger than a golf ball and about as heavy as a toothbrush, has a tiny 
snout, dark, bulbous eyes and, unsurprisingly, a fat tail. It's   Baby Yoda   levels of adorable -- and it may be just as influential.   Mapping
 the dunnart's genome could help this little animal become the marsupial
 equivalent of the lab mouse -- a model organism scientists use to 
better understand biological processes, manipulate genes and test new 
approaches to treating disease. The ambitious project, driven by 
marsupial geneticist Andrew Pask and his team at the University of 
Melbourne over the last two years, will see scientists take advantage of
 incredible feats of genetic engineering, reprogramming cells at will.   It
 could even aid the creation of a frozen Noah's Ark of samples: a 
doomsday vault of marsupial cells, suspended in time, to preserve 
genetic diversity and help prevent further decline, bringing species 
back from the brink of extinction.   If that sounds far-fetched, it isn't. In fact, it's already happening.   Creating
 a reliable marsupial model organism is a long-held dream for Australian
 geneticists, stretching back to research pioneered by famed 
statistician Ronald Fisher in the mid-20th century. To understand why 
the model is so important, we need to look at the lab mouse, a staple of
 science laboratories for centuries.   ""A lot of what we know about 
how genes work, and how genes work with each other, comes from the 
mouse,"" says Jenny Graves, a geneticist at La Trobe University in 
Victoria, Australia, who has worked with marsupials for five decades.   The mouse is an indispensable model organism that shares many genetic similarities with humans. It has been key in   understanding basic human biology, testing new medicines  
 and unraveling the mysteries of how our brains work. Mice form such a 
critical part of the scientific endeavor because they breed quickly, 
have large litters, and are cheap to house, feed and maintain.    The lab mouse has been indispensable in understanding physiology, biology and genetics.   In
 the 1970s, scientists developed a method to insert new genes into mice.
 After a decade of refinement, these genetically modified mice (known as
 ""transgenic mice"") provided novel ways to study how genes function. You
 could add a gene, turning its expression up to 11, or delete a gene 
entirely, shutting it off. Scientists had a powerful tool to discover 
which genes performed the critical work in reproduction, development and
 maturation.   The same capability does not exist for marsupials. 
""At the moment, we don't have any way of manipulating genes in a devil 
or a kangaroo or a possum,"" says Graves. Without this capability, it's 
difficult to answer more pointed questions about marsupial genes and how
 they compare with mammal genes, like those of mice and humans.   So
 far, two marsupial species -- the Tammar wallaby and the American 
opossum  -- have been front and center of research efforts to create a 
reliable model organism, but they both pose problems. The wallaby breeds
 slowly, with only one baby every 18 months, and it requires vast swaths
 of land to maintain.   The short-tailed opossum might prove an even
 more complicated case. Pask, the marsupial geneticist, says the small 
South American marsupial is prone to eating its young, and breeding 
requires researchers to sift through hours of video footage, looking for
 who impregnated whom. Pask also makes a patriotic jab (""they're 
American so we don't like them"") and says their differences from 
Australian marsupials make them less useful for the problems Australian 
species face.   But the dunnart boasts all the features that make 
the mouse such an attractive organism for study: It is small and easy to
 house, breeds well in captivity and has large litters.   ""Our little guys are just like having a mouse basically, except they have a pouch,"" Pask says.   Pask (front) and Frankenberg inspect some of their dunnarts at the University of Melbourne.   A stern warning precedes my first meeting with Pask's colony of fat-tailed dunnarts.   ""It smells like shit,"" he says. ""They shit everywhere.""   I
 quickly discover he's right. Upon entering the colony's dwellings on 
the third floor of the University of Melbourne's utilitarian BioSciences
 building, you're punched in the face by a musty, fecal smell.   Pask,
 a laid-back researcher whose face is almost permanently fixed with a 
smile, and one of his colleagues, researcher Stephen Frankenberg, appear
 unfazed by the odor. They've adapted to it. Inside the small room that 
houses the colony, storage-box-cages are stacked three shelves high. 
They're filled with upturned egg cartons and empty buckets, which work 
as makeshift nests for the critters to hide in.   Frankenberg reaches in without hesitation and plucks one from a cage 
-- nameless but numbered ""29"" -- and it hides in his enclosed fist 
before peeking out of the gap between his thumb and forefinger, snout 
pulsing. As I watch Frankenberg cradle it, the dunnart seems curious, 
and Pask warns me it's more than agile enough to manufacture a great 
escape.   In the wild, fat-tailed dunnarts are just as inquisitive 
and fleet-footed. Their range extends across most of southern and 
central Australia, and the most recent assessment of their population 
numbers shows they aren't suffering population declines in the same way 
many of Australia's bigger marsupial species are.   Move over, Baby Yoda.   As
 I watch 29 scamper up Frankenberg's arm, the physical similarities 
between it and a mouse are obvious. Pask explains that the dunnart's DNA
 is much more closely related to the Tasmanian devil, an endangered 
cat-sized carnivore native to Australia, than the mouse. But from a 
research perspective, Pask notes the similarities between mouse and 
dunnart run deep -- and that's why it's such an important critter.   ""The dunnart is going to be our marsupial workhorse like the mouse is for placental mammals,"" Pask says.   For
 that to happen, Pask's team has to perfect an incredible feat of 
genetic engineering: They have to learn how to reprogram its cells.   To do so, they collect skin cells from the dunnart's ear or footpad and drop them in a flask where  scientists can introduce new genes into the skin cell .
 The introduced genes are able to trick the adult cell, convincing it to
 become a ""younger,"" specialized cell with almost unlimited potential.   The
 reprogrammed cells are known as ""induced pluripotent stem cells,"" or 
iPS cells, and since Japanese scientists unraveled how to perform this 
incredible feat in 2006, they have proven to be indispensable for 
researchers because they can become  any  cell in the body.   ""You
 can grow them in culture and put different sorts of differentiation 
factors on them and see if they can turn into nerve cells, muscle cells,
 brain cells, blood vessels,"" Pask explains. That means these special 
cells could even be programmed to become a sperm or an egg, in turn 
allowing embryos to be made.   Implanting the embryo in a surrogate mother could create a  whole animal.    It took about 15 minutes to get this dunnart to sit still.   Although such a technological leap  has been made in mice , it's still a long way from fruition for marsupials. At present,  only the Tasmanian devil has had iPS cells created from skin , and no sperm or egg cells were produced.   Pask's team has been able to dupe the dunnart's cells into reverting to stem cells -- and they've even made some  slight genetic tweaks in the lab . But that's just the first step.   He
 believes there are likely to be small differences between species, but 
if the methodology remains consistent and reproducible in other 
marsupials, scientists could begin to create iPS cells from Australia's 
array of unique fauna. They could even sample skin cells from wild 
marsupials and reprogram those.   Doing so would be indispensable in
 the creation of a biobank, where the cells would be frozen down to -196
 degrees Celsius (-273AdegF) and stored until they're needed. It would act 
as a safeguard -- a backup copy of genetic material that could, in some 
distant future, be used to bring species back from the edge of oblivion,
 helping repopulate them and restoring their genetic diversity.   Underneath
 San Diego Zoo's Beckman Center for Conservation Research lies the 
Frozen Zoo, a repository of test tubes containing the genetic material 
of over 10,000 species. Stacked in towers and chilled inside giant metal
 vats, the tubes contain the DNA of threatened species from around the 
world, suspended in time.   It's the largest wildlife biobank in the world.   ""Our
 goal is to opportunistically collect cells ... on multiple individuals 
of as many species as we can, to provide a vast genetic resource for 
research and conservation efforts,"" explains Marlys Houck, curator at 
the Frozen Zoo.   The Zoo's efforts to save the northern white rhino from extinction  have been well publicized . Other research groups have been able to  create a northern white rhino embryo in the lab ,
 combining eggs of the last two remaining females with frozen sperm from
 departed males. Scientists propose implanting those embryos in a 
surrogate mother of a closely related species, the southern white rhino,
 to help drag the species back from the edge of oblivion.   For the 
better part of a decade, conservationists have been focused on this 
goal, and now their work is paying off: In the ""coming months,"" the  lab-created northern white rhino embryo will be implanted in a surrogate .   Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros, was euthanized in 2018.   Marisa
 Korody, a conservation geneticist at the Frozen Zoo, stresses that this
 type of intervention was really the last hope for the rhino, a species 
whose population had already diminished to just eight individuals a 
decade ago.   ""We only turn to these methods when more traditional conservation methods have failed,"" she says.   In Australia, researchers are telling whoever will listen that traditional conservation methods are failing.   ""We've
 been saying for decades and decades, many of our species are on a 
slippery slope,"" says John Rodger, a marsupial conservationist at the 
University of Newcastle, Australia, and CEO of the Fauna Research 
Alliance, which has long advocated for the banking of genetic material 
of species in Australia and New Zealand.   In October,  240 of Australia's top scientists delivered a letter to the government 
 detailing the country's woeful record on protecting species, citing the
 1,800 plants and animals in danger of extinction, and the ""weak"" 
environmental laws which have been ineffective at keeping Australian 
fauna alive.   Institutions around Australia, such as Taronga Zoo 
and Monash University, have been biobanking samples since the '90s, 
reliant on philanthropic donations to stay online, but researchers say 
this is not enough. For at least a decade, they've been  calling for the establishment of a national biobank to support Australia's threatened species .   ""Our real problem in Australia ... is underinvestment,"" Rodger says. ""You've got to accept this is not a short-term investment.""   The
 current government installed a threatened-species commissioner in 2017 
and committed $255 million ($171 million in US dollars) in funding to 
improve the prospects of 20 mammal species by 2020.  In the most recent progress report ,
 released in 2019, only eight of those 20 were identified as having an 
""improved trajectory,"" meaning populations were either increasing faster
 or declining slower compared to 2015.   A spokesperson for the 
commissioner outlined the $50 million investment to support immediate 
work to protect wildlife following the bushfires, speaking to monitoring
 programs, establishment of ""insurance populations"" and feral cat traps.
 No future strategies regarding biobanking were referenced.   Researchers believe we need to act now to preserve iconic Australian species like the koala.   In
 the wake of the catastrophic bushfire season and the challenges posed 
by climate change, Australia's extinction crisis is again in the 
spotlight. Koalas are plastered over social media with charred noses and
 bandaged skin. On the front page of newspapers, kangaroos bound in 
front of towering walls of flame.   Houck notes that San Diego's 
Frozen Zoo currently stores cell lines ""from nearly 30 marsupial 
species, including koala, Tasmanian devil and kangaroo,"" but that's only
 one-tenth of the known marsupial species living in Australia today.   ""Nobody
 in the world is seriously working on marsupials but us,"" Rodger says. 
""We've got a huge interest in maintaining these guys for tourism, 
national icons... you name it.""   There's a creeping sense of dread 
in the researchers I talk to that perhaps we've passed a tipping point, 
not just in Australia, but across the world. ""We are losing species at 
an alarming rate,"" says Korody from the Frozen Zoo. ""Some species are 
going extinct before we even know they are there.""   With such high 
stakes, Pask and his dunnarts are in a race against time. Perfecting the
 techniques to genetically engineer the tiny marsupial's cells will help
 enable the preservation of all marsupial species for generations to 
come, future-proofing them against natural disasters, disease, 
land-clearing and threats we may not even be able to predict right now.   Pask
 reasons ""we owe it"" to marsupials to develop these tools and, at the 
very least, biobank their cells if we can't prevent extinction. ""We 
really should be investing in this stuff now,"" he says. He's optimistic.   In
 some distant future, years from now, a bundle of frozen stem cells 
might just bring the koala or the kangaroo back from the brink of 
extinction.   And for that, we'll have the dunnart to thank.    Originally published Feb. 18, 5 a.m. PT.    "

central bank this month left interest rates on hold at a record-low of

 would be even 'weaker in the near term' from the effects of the summer

 Victorian diagnosed with lung cancer has almost double chances to be on
 treatment within 14 days when in private care than it has in the public
 health system.   New research released on Thursday by Lung 
Foundation Australia at the Australian Lung Cancer Conference 2020 held 
in Melbourne shows inequities between both systems.   These variation in times also occurs between regional and metropolitan centres, the research shows.   Sixty-one
 per cent of private patients in 2018, for instance, received treatment 
within 42 days of referral, as opposed to just a 26 per cent of public 
patients.   ""The findings of this study could have serious 
implications not just for Victoria but for Australia as a whole,"" Lung 
Foundation Australia CEO Mark Brooke said.   ""If you're a Victorian
 diagnosed with lung cancer today, the quality of care you receive and 
therefore your chances of survival might be heavily influenced by 
whether you live in the city or the country, your age, or if you have 
public or private health care.""   The Victorian Lung Cancer 
Registry, based at Monash University, claimed much of this variation 
could be due to the absence of available, specialist lung cancer nurses.   Lung
 Foundation Australia launched a petition on Wednesday calling on the 
federal government to fund 15 specialist lung cancer nurses in this 
year's budget.   More than 9000 Australians are expected to die 
from lung cancer in 2020, and experts say early detection is key to 
effective treatment.   Following in the footsteps of national 
screening programs for bowel, breast and cervical cancer, a bid to 
develop a lung cancer assessment plan began in December.   New 
funding could transform the future of personalised care and treatment 
administered for lung cancer patients across Australia, the government 
hopes.   A new clinical program announced in January will assess the impact of customised healthcare in lung cancer treatment.   The federal government has committed $5 million to help fund the program.     Advertisement    "

 the smoky, gray haze of the morning, it's hard to make out exactly what
 Matt Roberts' camera is capturing. Roberts, a photojournalist with the 
Australian Broadcasting Corporation, keeps his lens focused on the road 
as he rolls into the   fire-ravaged   town 55 miles west of Canberra, Australia's capital. At the asphalt's edge, blackened livestock carcasses lie motionless.   The grim scene,  widely shared on social media , is emblematic of the impact the 2019-20 bushfire season has had on Australia's animal life. Some estimates suggest  ""many, many billions"" of animals have been killed , populations of  endemic insects  could be crippled and, as ash washes into riverways,  marine life will be severely impacted . The scale of the bushfires is so massive, scientists are unlikely to know the impact on wildlife for many years.   But
 even before bushfires roared across the country, Australia's unique 
native animals were in a dire fight for survival. Habitat destruction, 
invasive species, hunting and climate change have conspired against 
them. Populations of native fauna are plummeting or disappearing 
altogether, leaving Australia with an unenviable record: It has the 
highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world.   A large share of 
Australia's extinctions have involved marsupials -- the class of mammals
 that includes the nation's iconic kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and 
wombats. A century ago, the   Tasmanian tiger  
 still padded quietly through Australia's forests. The desert 
rat-kangaroo hopped across the clay pans of the outback, sheltering from
 the sun in dug-out nests.   Now they're gone.   Australia's 2019-20 bushfire season has been devastating for wildlife.   In
 a search for answers to the extinction crisis, researchers are turning 
to one lesser-known species, small enough to fit in the palm of your 
hand: the fat-tailed dunnart. The carnivorous mouse-like marsupial, no 
bigger than a golf ball and about as heavy as a toothbrush, has a tiny 
snout, dark, bulbous eyes and, unsurprisingly, a fat tail. It's   Baby Yoda   levels of adorable -- and it may be just as influential.   Mapping
 the dunnart's genome could help this little animal become the marsupial
 equivalent of the lab mouse -- a model organism scientists use to 
better understand biological processes, manipulate genes and test new 
approaches to treating disease. The ambitious project, driven by 
marsupial geneticist Andrew Pask and his team at the University of 
Melbourne over the last two years, will see scientists take advantage of
 incredible feats of genetic engineering, reprogramming cells at will.   It
 could even aid the creation of a frozen Noah's Ark of samples: a 
doomsday vault of marsupial cells, suspended in time, to preserve 
genetic diversity and help prevent further decline, bringing species 
back from the brink of extinction.   If that sounds far-fetched, it isn't. In fact, it's already happening.   Creating
 a reliable marsupial model organism is a long-held dream for Australian
 geneticists, stretching back to research pioneered by famed 
statistician Ronald Fisher in the mid-20th century. To understand why 
the model is so important, we need to look at the lab mouse, a staple of
 science laboratories for centuries.   ""A lot of what we know about 
how genes work, and how genes work with each other, comes from the 
mouse,"" says Jenny Graves, a geneticist at La Trobe University in 
Victoria, Australia, who has worked with marsupials for five decades.   The mouse is an indispensable model organism that shares many genetic similarities with humans. It has been key in   understanding basic human biology, testing new medicines  
 and unraveling the mysteries of how our brains work. Mice form such a 
critical part of the scientific endeavor because they breed quickly, 
have large litters, and are cheap to house, feed and maintain.    The lab mouse has been indispensable in understanding physiology, biology and genetics.   In
 the 1970s, scientists developed a method to insert new genes into mice.
 After a decade of refinement, these genetically modified mice (known as
 ""transgenic mice"") provided novel ways to study how genes function. You
 could add a gene, turning its expression up to 11, or delete a gene 
entirely, shutting it off. Scientists had a powerful tool to discover 
which genes performed the critical work in reproduction, development and
 maturation.   The same capability does not exist for marsupials. 
""At the moment, we don't have any way of manipulating genes in a devil 
or a kangaroo or a possum,"" says Graves. Without this capability, it's 
difficult to answer more pointed questions about marsupial genes and how
 they compare with mammal genes, like those of mice and humans.   So
 far, two marsupial species -- the Tammar wallaby and the American 
opossum  -- have been front and center of research efforts to create a 
reliable model organism, but they both pose problems. The wallaby breeds
 slowly, with only one baby every 18 months, and it requires vast swaths
 of land to maintain.   The short-tailed opossum might prove an even
 more complicated case. Pask, the marsupial geneticist, says the small 
South American marsupial is prone to eating its young, and breeding 
requires researchers to sift through hours of video footage, looking for
 who impregnated whom. Pask also makes a patriotic jab (""they're 
American so we don't like them"") and says their differences from 
Australian marsupials make them less useful for the problems Australian 
species face.   But the dunnart boasts all the features that make 
the mouse such an attractive organism for study: It is small and easy to
 house, breeds well in captivity and has large litters.   ""Our little guys are just like having a mouse basically, except they have a pouch,"" Pask says.   Pask (front) and Frankenberg inspect some of their dunnarts at the University of Melbourne.   A stern warning precedes my first meeting with Pask's colony of fat-tailed dunnarts.   ""It smells like shit,"" he says. ""They shit everywhere.""   I
 quickly discover he's right. Upon entering the colony's dwellings on 
the third floor of the University of Melbourne's utilitarian BioSciences
 building, you're punched in the face by a musty, fecal smell.   Pask,
 a laid-back researcher whose face is almost permanently fixed with a 
smile, and one of his colleagues, researcher Stephen Frankenberg, appear
 unfazed by the odor. They've adapted to it. Inside the small room that 
houses the colony, storage-box-cages are stacked three shelves high. 
They're filled with upturned egg cartons and empty buckets, which work 
as makeshift nests for the critters to hide in.   Frankenberg reaches in without hesitation and plucks one from a cage 
-- nameless but numbered ""29"" -- and it hides in his enclosed fist 
before peeking out of the gap between his thumb and forefinger, snout 
pulsing. As I watch Frankenberg cradle it, the dunnart seems curious, 
and Pask warns me it's more than agile enough to manufacture a great 
escape.   In the wild, fat-tailed dunnarts are just as inquisitive 
and fleet-footed. Their range extends across most of southern and 
central Australia, and the most recent assessment of their population 
numbers shows they aren't suffering population declines in the same way 
many of Australia's bigger marsupial species are.   Move over, Baby Yoda.   As
 I watch 29 scamper up Frankenberg's arm, the physical similarities 
between it and a mouse are obvious. Pask explains that the dunnart's DNA
 is much more closely related to the Tasmanian devil, an endangered 
cat-sized carnivore native to Australia, than the mouse. But from a 
research perspective, Pask notes the similarities between mouse and 
dunnart run deep -- and that's why it's such an important critter.   ""The dunnart is going to be our marsupial workhorse like the mouse is for placental mammals,"" Pask says.   For
 that to happen, Pask's team has to perfect an incredible feat of 
genetic engineering: They have to learn how to reprogram its cells.   To do so, they collect skin cells from the dunnart's ear or footpad and drop them in a flask where  scientists can introduce new genes into the skin cell .
 The introduced genes are able to trick the adult cell, convincing it to
 become a ""younger,"" specialized cell with almost unlimited potential.   The
 reprogrammed cells are known as ""induced pluripotent stem cells,"" or 
iPS cells, and since Japanese scientists unraveled how to perform this 
incredible feat in 2006, they have proven to be indispensable for 
researchers because they can become  any  cell in the body.   ""You
 can grow them in culture and put different sorts of differentiation 
factors on them and see if they can turn into nerve cells, muscle cells,
 brain cells, blood vessels,"" Pask explains. That means these special 
cells could even be programmed to become a sperm or an egg, in turn 
allowing embryos to be made.   Implanting the embryo in a surrogate mother could create a  whole animal.    It took about 15 minutes to get this dunnart to sit still.   Although such a technological leap  has been made in mice , it's still a long way from fruition for marsupials. At present,  only the Tasmanian devil has had iPS cells created from skin , and no sperm or egg cells were produced.   Pask's team has been able to dupe the dunnart's cells into reverting to stem cells -- and they've even made some  slight genetic tweaks in the lab . But that's just the first step.   He
 believes there are likely to be small differences between species, but 
if the methodology remains consistent and reproducible in other 
marsupials, scientists could begin to create iPS cells from Australia's 
array of unique fauna. They could even sample skin cells from wild 
marsupials and reprogram those.   Doing so would be indispensable in
 the creation of a biobank, where the cells would be frozen down to -196
 degrees Celsius (-273AdegF) and stored until they're needed. It would act 
as a safeguard -- a backup copy of genetic material that could, in some 
distant future, be used to bring species back from the edge of oblivion,
 helping repopulate them and restoring their genetic diversity.   Underneath
 San Diego Zoo's Beckman Center for Conservation Research lies the 
Frozen Zoo, a repository of test tubes containing the genetic material 
of over 10,000 species. Stacked in towers and chilled inside giant metal
 vats, the tubes contain the DNA of threatened species from around the 
world, suspended in time.   It's the largest wildlife biobank in the world.   ""Our
 goal is to opportunistically collect cells ... on multiple individuals 
of as many species as we can, to provide a vast genetic resource for 
research and conservation efforts,"" explains Marlys Houck, curator at 
the Frozen Zoo.   The Zoo's efforts to save the northern white rhino from extinction  have been well publicized . Other research groups have been able to  create a northern white rhino embryo in the lab ,
 combining eggs of the last two remaining females with frozen sperm from
 departed males. Scientists propose implanting those embryos in a 
surrogate mother of a closely related species, the southern white rhino,
 to help drag the species back from the edge of oblivion.   For the 
better part of a decade, conservationists have been focused on this 
goal, and now their work is paying off: In the ""coming months,"" the  lab-created northern white rhino embryo will be implanted in a surrogate .   Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros, was euthanized in 2018.   Marisa
 Korody, a conservation geneticist at the Frozen Zoo, stresses that this
 type of intervention was really the last hope for the rhino, a species 
whose population had already diminished to just eight individuals a 
decade ago.   ""We only turn to these methods when more traditional conservation methods have failed,"" she says.   In Australia, researchers are telling whoever will listen that traditional conservation methods are failing.   ""We've
 been saying for decades and decades, many of our species are on a 
slippery slope,"" says John Rodger, a marsupial conservationist at the 
University of Newcastle, Australia, and CEO of the Fauna Research 
Alliance, which has long advocated for the banking of genetic material 
of species in Australia and New Zealand.   In October,  240 of Australia's top scientists delivered a letter to the government 
 detailing the country's woeful record on protecting species, citing the
 1,800 plants and animals in danger of extinction, and the ""weak"" 
environmental laws which have been ineffective at keeping Australian 
fauna alive.   Institutions around Australia, such as Taronga Zoo 
and Monash University, have been biobanking samples since the '90s, 
reliant on philanthropic donations to stay online, but researchers say 
this is not enough. For at least a decade, they've been  calling for the establishment of a national biobank to support Australia's threatened species .   ""Our real problem in Australia ... is underinvestment,"" Rodger says. ""You've got to accept this is not a short-term investment.""   The
 current government installed a threatened-species commissioner in 2017 
and committed $255 million ($171 million in US dollars) in funding to 
improve the prospects of 20 mammal species by 2020.  In the most recent progress report ,
 released in 2019, only eight of those 20 were identified as having an 
""improved trajectory,"" meaning populations were either increasing faster
 or declining slower compared to 2015.   A spokesperson for the 
commissioner outlined the $50 million investment to support immediate 
work to protect wildlife following the bushfires, speaking to monitoring
 programs, establishment of ""insurance populations"" and feral cat traps.
 No future strategies regarding biobanking were referenced.   Researchers believe we need to act now to preserve iconic Australian species like the koala.   In
 the wake of the catastrophic bushfire season and the challenges posed 
by climate change, Australia's extinction crisis is again in the 
spotlight. Koalas are plastered over social media with charred noses and
 bandaged skin. On the front page of newspapers, kangaroos bound in 
front of towering walls of flame.   Houck notes that San Diego's 
Frozen Zoo currently stores cell lines ""from nearly 30 marsupial 
species, including koala, Tasmanian devil and kangaroo,"" but that's only
 one-tenth of the known marsupial species living in Australia today.   ""Nobody
 in the world is seriously working on marsupials but us,"" Rodger says. 
""We've got a huge interest in maintaining these guys for tourism, 
national icons... you name it.""   There's a creeping sense of dread 
in the researchers I talk to that perhaps we've passed a tipping point, 
not just in Australia, but across the world. ""We are losing species at 
an alarming rate,"" says Korody from the Frozen Zoo. ""Some species are 
going extinct before we even know they are there.""   With such high 
stakes, Pask and his dunnarts are in a race against time. Perfecting the
 techniques to genetically engineer the tiny marsupial's cells will help
 enable the preservation of all marsupial species for generations to 
come, future-proofing them against natural disasters, disease, 
land-clearing and threats we may not even be able to predict right now.   Pask
 reasons ""we owe it"" to marsupials to develop these tools and, at the 
very least, biobank their cells if we can't prevent extinction. ""We 
really should be investing in this stuff now,"" he says. He's optimistic.   In
 some distant future, years from now, a bundle of frozen stem cells 
might just bring the koala or the kangaroo back from the brink of 
extinction.   And for that, we'll have the dunnart to thank.    Originally published Feb. 18, 5 a.m. PT.    "

The summer  bushfires  and the  coronavirus  are widely expected to smash the already struggling economy, with the bad news pushing up the unemployment rate in January.   Australia
 would be plunged into a technical recession, should gross domestic
 product shrink in the December quarter and also go backwards in the 
March quarter.    KPMG chief economist Dr Brendan Rynne, 
however, said an extra leap year day was likely to stop an economic 
contraction in the first three months of 2020 - as February 29 added an 
extra $5.2billion to Australia's gross domestic product.   Australia could avoid falling into a recession for the first time in three decades because 2020 is a leap year.

Australia's
 unemployment rate rose to 5.3 per cent in January up from 5.1 per cent a
 month earlier, official data released on Thursday showed.    Victoria's
 jobless rate surged from 4.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent - the highest in 
19 months, in a state where bushfire-affected resident were evacuated by
 the Navy from Mallacoota.   In Queensland, unemployment surged from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent.     The
 Reserve Bank of Australia is expecting the bushfires and coronavirus to
 have 'reduced GDP growth over the December and March quarters' but 
stopped short of predicting an economic contraction, in the minutes of 
its February meeting.   Dr Rynne said the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics's national accounts data for the first three months of 2020 
would be unlikely to show the economy in negative territory, even though
 it is weak.   'While there is an underlying weakness in economic 
activity consistent with potentially negative growth, the addition of 
February 29 into this yearas calendar may in fact mean that Australia a 
and possibly many other countries that follow the United Nation's System
 of National Accounts a will not see this result in the March quarter 
2020,' he said.   The summer bushfires and the coronavirus 
are widely expected to smash the already struggling economy, with the 
bad news pushing up the unemployment rate in January. Pictured are Rural
 Fire Service volunteers battling blazes at Bilpin west of Sydney in

 economic growth pace of 1.4 per cent in mid-2019 was the slowest since 
the global financial crisis a decade earlier.    Annual GDP 
expansion ticked up to 1.7 per cent in the September but this level was 
well below the 3.2 per cent average between the time of the last 
recession in 1991 and 2018.    Dr Rynne said there was still underlying weakness in the Australian economy.   'The Australian economy is stuttering at the moment,' he said.   KPMG
 chief economist Dr Brendan Rynne, however, said an extra leap year day 
was likely to stop an economic contraction in the first three months of 
2020 - as February 29 added an extra $5.2billion to Australia's gross 
domestic product. Pictured is a woman wearing a face mask in

 China, where tens of millions of residents are in lockdown to contain 
the escalating crisis   'Underlying structural problems like 
weak wages growth, high household debt, and now slowing commodity prices
 are being compounded by extraordinary events such as drought, bushfires
 and the coronavirus.'   Australian wages grew by just 2.2 per cent 
last year, and have failed to rise above the three per cent level since 
mid-2013 while the household-debt-to-income ratio of 186.5 per cent is 
close to a record high.   EY chief economist Jo Masters said the 
increase in unemployment made another interest rate cut more likely this
 year, with the cash rate already at a record-low of 0.75 per 
cent.    'There is clearly plenty of spare capacity in the 
labour market, suggesting little progress in lifting wage growth any 
time soon,' she said.    'This data will reinforce expectations that the RBA will need to cut interest rates again this year.'

 were horrified to learn people had stopped going to eateries because of
 the hysteria- but said it seemed like the fear was greatest among the 
Chinese community itself.      'Deliberately ate at a
 Chinese restaurant in St Kilda. There were no Asian customers but quite
 a few non Asians. I queried the young Chinese cashier if this was 
normal, she said no and she confessed to being petrified having to work 
there,' the commenter wrote.    'The misinformation amongst the Chinese community is puzzling, especially if it means a number of restaurants going broke.'   Getup: 'If we don't take action a people will lose their jobs, and their livelihoods'    Chatswood,
 in Sydney's Lower North Shore, and Eastwood in the north-west - which 
have large Chinese populations - have been bearing the brunt of 
the hysteria surrounding the disease, with some shops reporting 
that trade has slumped more than 70 per cent since the 
outbreak.      The only shops that appear to be making money amid the health scare are chemists selling face-masks and hand-sanitiser.   Owners
 of pharmacists and vitamin stores said they were busier than ever 
with some saying the demand for face masks has jumped by 300 per cent.   Michael
 Lam, owner of Star Capital Seafood Restaurant on Chatswood's normally 
busy Victoria Avenue, has shut down his restaurant after seven 
years.    Mr Lam previously told Daily Mail Australia he made 
the decision following weeks of poor sales as well as the Prime 
Minister's move to ban non-citizens from flying to Australia from 
China.     'Business has become terrible, usually by 
11.30am the place is full and now we are lucky to get four or five 
people,' he told Daily Mail Australia.    'As soon as the Prime Minister said flights from China were stopping, I decided to close.'     Star
 Capital Seafood Restaurant on Chatswood's normally busy Victoria Avenue
 opened seven years ago but owner Michael Lam has decided to close the 
doors for good   Star Capital Seafood Restaurant closed earlier this month after seven years of business   Mr
 Lam said he had already been thinking about retiring, but Mr Morrison's
 announcement prompted him to make the decision earlier.     'This week we have been selling lobsters for $88 per kilogram, but last week they were $130 a kilo,' the business-owner said.    'The locals aren't coming out so we cannot sell, it's very, very bad.'   Universities,
 schools, student accommodation providers, hotels, restaurants, tourist 
operators and airlines have been hit by ban, which may last for longer 
than a fortnight if the outbreak worsens.   Education industry 
officials said the travel ban could cost their industry alone up to $8 
billion in the worst case scenario.    Local councils are pleading with customers to return to the usually bustling centres.    The Star Capital Seafood Restaurant is practically empty of diners during a normally busy time at midday on a weekday   Chatswood in Sydney's Lower North Shore has become a virtual  ghost town with many residents wearing masks   A worker at Tim's Barbeque Chatswood, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that business wasn't very good in the area   Chinese restaurants in Chatswood are practically empty as the suburb has turned into a ghost town   Staff at Chatswood BBQ Kitchen said the situation was dire.

 is a similar story in Eastwood where some shop owners have reported a 
downturn over more than 70 per cent since the coronavirus outbreak.   Manager
 at Happigo Supermarket, Bobby, said the drop in sales was 'very quick' 
and business has been bad for nearly two weeks.    'The Chinese community has become very quiet...there's not many people on the street,' he said.   'People are scared of the coronavirus.'   Manager
 at Happigo Supermarket, Bobby, said the drop in sales was 'very quick'

his shop just one-and-a-half weeks before the coronavirus outbreak

Hardship Fund to help Eastwood Town Centre.   Part of the money will go towards subsidised gift vouchers to revamp the local economy.   Mr
 Laxale said the main focus of the campaign was to educate people about 
coronavirus in the area to avoid misinformation being spread.   'Eastwood
 has been targeted with false information. The fact is Eastwood is safe 
and we want to educate the public and get the right facts out there,' he
 told the Northern District Times.   'The last three weeks it's been
 a ghost town and it's an incorrect perception of Eastwood. It's not

 away from Eastwood and there is nothing out there to say Eastwood is 
not safe. I'm calling on the local MP Victor Dominello and the Premier 
to do the same.'   There have been 14 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, and more than 24,000 cases and more than 490 deaths globally.

1454521197,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-toll-idUKKBN20E088,2020-02-20,China posts sharp drop in new coronavirus cases after criteria change," BEIJING
 (Reuters) - Mainland China reported on Thursday the lowest number of 
confirmed cases of a new coronavirus since late January, partly because 
of a change in diagnostic criteria for patients in Hubei province, the 
epicenter of the outbreak.     China had 394 new confirmed cases on 
Wednesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, sharply down from 
1,749 cases a day earlier and the lowest since Jan. 23.     That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 74,576.    The
 new coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan, the capital of the 
central province of Hubei, in December, having apparently been passed to
 people from wildlife sold illegally in a market.    Just how cases 
are diagnosed and confirmed has had a big impact on official tallies of 
cases, and changes in the method have raised questions about the extent 
to which daily tallies accurately reflect the state of the outbreak.    Initially,
 authorities were using nucleic acid tests to identify the presence of 
the virus, but such tests require days of processing, and there were 
also shortages of nucleic acid.    So last week, Hubei introduced a 
new, quicker diagnostic method through computerized tomography (CT) 
scans, which use X-rays, to reveal lung infections, and to confirm the 
presence of the virus.    The CT scan method of diagnosis resulted 
in suspected cases that showed signs of pneumonia, but did not test 
positive for genetic traces of the virus, being counted as confirmed 
cases of the coronavirus.    That led to a surge of more than 15,000
 new coronavirus infections for Feb. 12, and sparked unfounded fears 
that the virus was suddenly spreading much faster.    But on 
Wednesday, the NHC said it was removing that category of clinically 
diagnosed cases from its criteria for confirmed cases, meaning 279 cases
 would be removed from the Hubei tally.    The commission said the nucleic acid test was the preferred method of diagnosis.    As
 a result, Hubei, which accounts for most of Chinaas infections, saw a 
sharp drop in confirmed cases, as reflected in the data announced on 
Thursday, with 349 new confirmed cases tallied on Wednesday, down from 
1,693 on Tuesday and the lowest since Jan. 25.    The clinical 
diagnoses were a astop-gap measure,a Wang Guiqiang, head of infectious 
diseases at Peking University First Hospital, said at a regular NHC 
press briefing.    There is no longer a supply issue for nucleic acid tests as there was before, he said.    For
 Hubei, even if the authorities restored the 279 cases that were 
subtracted from the tally, the number of new cases on Wednesday would 
still be at least 1,000 less than a day earlier.     Allen
 Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne,
 said he did not understand why cases diagnosed by different methods at 
different times had to be added or subtracted to tallies on other days.    aBest
 practice would be to assign the cases to the date they are reported. 
This was also an issue with the large number of cases reported on Feb. 
12,a he said.          People

 Garcia Rawlins    Excluding Hubei, 
the number of new confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 45 on 
Wednesday, down from 56 a day earlier and falling for the 16th 
consecutive day.    Provinces, regions and municipalities that 
reported no new confirmed cases on Wednesday included Liaoning, Fujian, 
Shanxi, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Ningxi, Inner Mongolia and Qinghai.    The
 situation is still severe, although efforts to curb the coronavirus in 
Hubei have made progress, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said on Wednesday.    Reporting

 are being ordered to test Australians who have travelled to Bali in the
 past two weeks for the coronavirus if they have any flu symptoms.    This
 week NSW and Victorian health authorities updated their advice to test 
for the virus if patients had been to Thailand, Hong Kong,  Japan , Singapore, or  Indonesia  and show signs of 'a clinically compatible illness'.    'This recommendation is based on the volume of travel between these countries, Australia and  China , and the current epidemiology of COVID-19,' the updated advice, seen by the Sydney Morning Herald and  The Age  said.    GPs
 are being ordered to test Australians who have travelled to Bali in the
 past two weeks for coronavirus if they have any signs of flu 
symptoms    Though Indonesian authorities have 
tested some people for COVID-19 they have not reported any confirmed 
cases to the World Health Organisation     The countries 
mentioned have recorded multiple cases of coronavirus with the exception
 of Indonesia which has not reported any cases to the World Health 
Organisation.    Experts, however, have said the country, which
 includes the popular tourist island of Bali, would likely have 
undetected cases.    University of Queensland professor of 
virology Ian Mackay said he was sceptical Indonesia did not have one 
case of COVID-19 adding that 'it's a big country' and likely to have 
undetected infections.    Royal Australian College of General 
Practitioners president Harry Nespolon agreed, saying anyone returning 
from Bali and experiencing flu-like symptoms should be tested for the 
virus.    'Indonesia's got a population of 267 million people, 
it has almost no effective screening - they say they do, but they 
probably don't. If you're looking at the stats, there should be some 
cases in Indonesia,' he said.    Figures show that about 25,000 people flew between Australia and Bali each week during 2019    The
 updated testing guidelines stem from the communicable Diseases Network 
Australia which is chaired by the country's chief medical officer 
Brendan Murphy.    The advice contradicts the federal health 
department's guidelines that only people that have been to China should 
be tested.    Figures show that about 25,000 people flew 
between Australia and Bali each week during 2019 - which means more than
 100,000 people have probably made the trip since the outbreak began 
towards the end of December.    Bali is also a top tourist spot for China with about 1.2 million Chinese tourists travelling to the island in 2019.    It is understood Indonesia has tested just 112 people for COVID-19 with 108 being negative and four being processed.    The
 current SmartTraveller advice for Indonesia does not include a warning 
about coronavirus but some other south-east Asian countries such as 
Thailand have the warning the tourists should take precautions.    Bali's airport (pictured) is a hub for tourists from Australia and many south-east Asian countries      NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

international students to get around the coronavirus travel ban   Western
 Sydney University (pictured) told its international students it would 
subside the cost of airfares and accommodation to allow them to reach 
Australia 'through a third country'   The ban can be dodged though by going through a country which does not have a travel ban on those coming from China.    Those countries include Thailand, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and Japan.   In the e-mail being circulated online this week, the university said the $1500 payment would be made after arrival in Australia.   'We
 consider the Australian Government's endorsement of entering Australia 
through a third country an important development, opening up the 
opportunity to arrive in time to commence study in Australia,' the 
e-mail said.   The move has been hailed by the Sydney Student 
Representatives' Council, which said universities capable of helping 
subsidise travel costs should be helping out.   'The fact 
international students are paying $45,000 annually for tuition fees does
 not mean they should always pay more,' the council's general 
secretary Abbey Shi told  The Australian .   Travel
 agents are taking advantage of the loophole in the travel ban by 
selling 14-day travel packages to go-between countries such as 
Dubai.    In the e-mail being circulated online this week, the university said the $1500 payment would be made after arrival in Australia   One package included a stay in a four-star hotel, a personal guide and face masks.   On
 Wednesday, the Australian government confirmed it would be extending 
the travel ban from mainland China for another week until February 
29.    The decision was made by the national security committee
 of cabinet on Thursday as the number of infections and deaths in Hubei 
province, the epicentre of the virus, continues to grow.   Foreign 
nationals - excluding permanent Australian residents - who have been in

Almost 40,000 years later, new scientific evidence suggests this 
long-shared legend of the Dreaming could be much more than a myth.   New
 mineral-dating measurements conducted by Australian scientists 
highlight the possibility that the traditional telling of Budj Bim's 
origins may be an actual account of two historic volcanic eruptions that
 took place in the region about 37,000 years ago a which, if true, might
 make this the oldest story ever told on Earth.   ""If aspects of oral traditions pertaining to Budj Bim or its 
surrounding lava landforms reflect volcanic activity, this could be 
interpreted as evidence for these being some of the oldest oral 
traditions in existence,"" the researchers, led by geologist Erin Matchan
 from the University of Melbourne, write in their study.    Up 
until now, most evidence for the oldest known human habitation in 
Australia comes from radiocarbon dating or optically stimulated 
luminescence (OSL) dating, using samples of ancient charcoal, or 
sediments from rock shelters.

of the Maroon Bells are among the most-photographed vistas in Colorado's
 Rocky Mountains. The mountains received their distinctive maroon 
colouring from the weathering of hematite, an iron-bearing mineral.   The Icefields Parkway opened in 1940 
and provides visitors with access to stunning mountain vistas, glaciers,
 wildlife and turquoise lakes. The 230 km road travels through two 
national parks: Banff National Park and Jasper National Park in Canada.   The Pirin mountains are Bulgaria's 
second-highest mountain range, named after Perun, the Slavic thunder 
god. It consists of hundreds of peaks over 6,561 feet (2,000 metres) 
tall and is an ideal place for hiking.   These dramatic red rock formations in the Gulf of Porto are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.   Located in the Totes Gebirge

Switzerlandas Bernese Alps. From the station, visitors can make their 
way into the Top of Europe building, where the 'highest train station in
 Europe' designation becomes breathtakingly clear. Opened in 1912, the 
Jungfrau railway runs for less than 6 miles and most of that route 
passes through a mountain tunnel. This spot is so scenic that viewing 
windows were cut into parts of the tunnel, allowing passengers to 
disembark the train and gaze out at the spectacular vistas.   In front of Olstinden Peak is the

   Unfortunately, a lack of both ceramic artefacts and permanent 
structures in the Indigenous Australian context makes finding 
archaeological samples a challenge. Only six sites in southeast 
Australia have been definitively dated to older than 30,000 years, the 
researchers say a despite evidence from elsewhere in the country 
suggesting it could have been inhabited as far back as 65,000 years ago,
 or even older.    Luckily, recent technological advancements in 
an alternative technique called argonaargon dating could provide new 
ways of dating volcanic rock in the southeast landscape, especially when
 coupled with interpretations of cultural knowledge, the authors 
suggest.   ""The oral traditions of Australian Aboriginal peoples 
have enabled perpetuation of ecological knowledge across many 
generations, providing a valuable resource of archaeological 
information,"" Matchan and study co-author David Phillips explain in an 
article summarising their findings.   ""Some surviving traditions 
appear to reference geological events such as volcanic eruptions, 
earthquakes, and meteorite impacts, and it has been proposed that some 
of these traditions may have been transmitted for thousands of years.""   In
 the case of the now-extinct Budj Bim volcano, and another nearby 
inactive volcano located 40 kilometres (25 mils) away, called Tower 
Hill, we now have a better estimate of just how many thousands of years 
ago their ancient eruptions happened, thanks to the argonaargon 
technique.   In the new research, the team dated a sample from a 
lava bomb hurled from the historic Tower Hill eruption, along with a 
sample of lava flow from Budj Bim's eruption.   The results suggest 
the eruptions may have been contemporaneous, with lava dated to 36,800 
years ago (A+- 3,800 years) for Tower Hill, and 36,900 years ago (A+- 3,100 
years) for Budj Bim.   Given Tower Hill's eruption was the most 
recent comparatively, the researchers suggest its eruption age ""directly
 constrains a minimum age for human presence in Victoria"".   That 
conclusion is based on the existence of a lone stone axe a called the 
'Bushfield axe' a which was previously discovered buried beneath a 
layer of volcanic rock and ash from the eruption, and is therefore 
considered to be evidence of contemporaneous human occupation in the 
area.   As for whether the long-told oral tradition of Budj Bim 
truly chronicles these awesome, ancient volcanic outbursts, it's 
impossible to be sure. Some researchers say we need to be 
cautious about how we interpret stories from so long ago.   But we should also be curious.   ""We
 in the West have only scratched the surface of understanding the 
longevity of Australian Indigenous oral histories,"" archaeologist Ian 
McNiven from Monash University told  Science .   The findings are reported in  Geology .

 was recorded on December 31 in Wuhan, China, and since then, cases have
 been recorded in 26 other countries around the world. In the UK, nine 
cases have been confirmed. The UK Chief Medical Officers have raised the
 risk to the public catching coronavirus in the UK from low to moderate,
 but the risk to individuals remains low.   While 
researchers establish how exactly coronavirus is spread, it has been 
noted how similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.   These droplets can settle on surfaces, causing the virus to spread.   One surface which could prove particular troublesome is mobile phone screens.   Mobile phones have become an essential in most peopleas every day life.

But experts have warned of the circumstance when you could catch coronavirus from your device.   Dr
 Richard Dawood of Fleet Street Clinic said itas possible to catch 
coronavirus from your mobile phone if someone else carrying the 
infection has handled it.   Professor Stephen Turner from Monash 
University added you could catch the virus from lending out your mobile 
phone to someone with the virus, they coughed and sneezed on it, and you
 then used it after them.    DON'T MISS    Dr Dawood advises using an alcohol or detergent-based screen cleaner to rid your phone of any germs.   Keeping your phone to yourself also wouldnat be a bad idea.   Earlier this year, Dr Shikha Pitalia, GP and director at Pall Mall Medical,  revealed a dirty phone screen can carry the flu virus .    She
 told The Mirror: aThe average Brit checks their phone every 12 minutes 
when theyare awake and coupling this with poor hand hygiene and a dirty 
smartphone screen creates the perfect storm for many of us to pick up 
the flu this winter.           Coronavirus: Your mobile phone could harbour the deadly virus if you lend it out  (Image: GETTY)     aFlu

in order to minimise the risk of us contracting or spreading the virus.""   Dr
 Pitaliaas team found phone screens can contain a range of nasty bugs, 
including those responsible for the common cold and flu, as well as 
pneumonia, strep throat, gastroenteritis and diphtheria.   They also found the average smartphone can carry 10 times as many germs as the typical toilet seat.   If
 the new coronavirus resembled other human coronaviruses, such as SARS 
and MERS, it could stay on surfaces for as long as nine days, according 
to a new study.           Coronavirus: Regularly clean your phone to keep it germ-free  (Image: GETTY)     In

The National Security Committee of Cabinet on Thursday extended those restrictions for another week.   The coronavirus has so far killed more than 2,000 people worldwide and infected another 75,000, including 15 Australians.   China,
 Australia's biggest trading partner, has lobbied the Australian 
government to make a quarantine exemption for students who aren't from 
Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak.    Scroll down for video     International
 students coming to Australia from China could soon have their 
quarantine restrictions eased despite the worsening coronavirus outbreak
 (people wearing face masks in Beijing, pictured)   With the 
university semester due to begin in March, Prime Minister Scott Morrison
 has hinted quarantine exemptions could be considered for Chinese 
students outside Hubei and the city of Wuhan.    'The [medical 
advice] committee has advised that there are signs the spread of the 
coronavirus in Chinese provinces outside Hubei province is slowing,' he 
told The Australian Financial Review.    'We will need to watch closely whether this positive trend continues as people return to work after the holidays.'     Australia's education exports to China are worth $32billion a year.   Australia's
 Group of Eight universities, which have 105,000 Chinese students 
between them, last week estimated the travel ban will cost the economy 
more than $1billion, jeopardising 7,500 jobs and sparking a 10 per cent 
decline in Chinese students. Pictured is Nanjing rail station   The economy would suffer if Chinese international students abandoned their studies in Australia.    'One of
 the other things that we're also looking very carefully at is the 
mitigations and the things we can do to try and minimise the impact on 
particular sectors, particularly in the education sector,' Mr Morrison 
said.   Australia's most elite universities, known as the Group of Eight, have 105,000 Chinese students between them.   They
 last week estimated the travel ban would cost the economy more than 
$1billion, jeopardising 7,500 jobs and sparking a 10 per cent decline in
 Chinese students.    Western Sydney University told its 
international students on Wednesday it would subside the cost of 
airfares and accommodation to allow them to reach Australia 'through a 
third country', creating a loophole in the ban.    In an email being circulated online, the university said the $1500 payment would be made after arrival in Australia.    With

 Minister Greg Hunt announced that some of the 760 students would 
be allowed to return to school in Australia on a 'case-by-case 
basis' on Saturday.       'In particular, that 
should include consideration of year 11 and 12 secondary school students
 from mainland China, excluding Hubei,' Mr Hunt told reporters in 
Melbourne.     'Coronavirus has been contained in Australia with no new cases in the general population in the last week.'     Hubei
 province has been excluded as it is where the outbreak city of Wuhan is
 located, meaning there is a higher risk of coronavirus.     Health
 Minister Greg Hunt announced that some of the 760 students trapped in 
China would be allowed to return to school in Australia on a 
'case-by-case basis' on Saturday    The trapped students have already missed three weeks of school as the the  first school term of the year began in late January and early February across the country.      Once
 in Australia, they will have to follow 'the same strict isolation 
conditions that apply to Australian citizens and permanent residents who
 return from China'.    This means that they will have to spend
 another two weeks at home in isolation at home, further delaying their 
return to school.    In total, some students could miss five or six weeks of school - half of the first term.    All
 states and territories have strict school attendance requirements, 
which mean students may not be able to complete their secondary 
qualifications if they miss too many days of education.    In a
 statement, the Australian government stated it recognises 'the 
importance of the final two years of school', which is why the ban was 
lifted on senior students.    'All Australian governments 
understand the importance of education and we are all working to 
minimise the impact of COVID-19 on students,' the statement read.    A

foreign travellers from China for another week on Saturday.    The ban is due to end on February 29 but is under ongoing consideration from the national security committee of cabinet.    Two
 universities are offering cash incentives to Chinese students to 
encourage them to keep up their studies despite not being allowed into 
Australia.    The University of Adelaide  is offering a care package worth about $5,000 to about 3,000 Chinese students.   The
 package includes a 20 per cent discount on semester one tuition fees 
and up to $2,000 towards airfares which they can access only once the 
travel ban is lifted.    It also offered online study help 
including videos of lectures, peer networking support and library 
resources so Chinese students who cannot be on campus by the March 26 
start date, so can keep up with their courses remotely.    The

from the Chinese mainland where the majority of COVID-19 cases are in an
 attempt to keep the highly infectious new virus out of Australia.   Of
 those who develop COVID-19, 14 per cent suffer a serious illness 
while 5 per cent become critical, needing intensive care in 
hospital.   The SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19.
 Because nobody is immune the highly infectious virus spreads quickly 
through the population. Latest studies show 14 per cent of those 
infected become seriously ill while 5 per cent go into critical 
condition   COVID-19 has an overall fatality rate of 2.3 per 
cent, according to official figures from the Chinese Centres of 
Disease Control, with people over 60 most likely to die.   The 
Australian Government has said it plans to relax the coronavirus travel 
ban on February 29 to allow 1000 Chinese research students to come 
directly to Australia with more to follow later, The Australian 
newspaper reported.    Most of the Chinese students affected by
 the ban are enrolled at top Group of Eight universities. Group of Eight
 Australia has denied it is lobbying the government to drop the medical 
ban.   Chinese students are increasingly desperate to start term 
before the semester one cut-off as an interruption in their studies can 
affect their visa requirements.    The Australian newspaper 
quoted a student enrolled at RMIT named Ben, who did not want to give 
his full name, but said he was going to risk flying to Australia on 
February 23 even though he might not get in.    Western 
Sydney University (pictured) told its international students it would 
subside the cost of airfares and accommodation to allow them to reach 
Australia 'through a third country'   Rising numbers of 
Chinese students have been able to beat the travel ban by detouring via 
third countries where they spend 14 days before they can enter 
Australia.    The ban can be dodged though by going through a country which does not have a travel ban on those coming from China.    Those countries include Thailand, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and Japan.   Melbourne
 education consultant Gary Li is based in Bangkok where he is helping 
Chinese students to transit to Australia via Thailand, told The 
Australian his students did not regret going via a third country as they
 did not know how long the travel ban would be in force.    Western
 Sydney University told its international students on Wednesday it would
 subside the cost of airfares and accommodation to allow them to reach 
Australia 'through a third country'.    In the email being circulated online this week, the university said the $1500 payment would be made after arrival in Australia.   'We
 consider the Australian Government's endorsement of entering Australia 
through a third country an important development, opening up the 
opportunity to arrive in time to commence study in Australia,' the 
e-mail said.   A Western Sydney University spokesman confirmed the 
payment and told Daily Mail Australia it had encouraged its students to 
take this option after advice from the federal Department of 
Health.    'Our students are keen to travel to Australia and start the new academic year as soon as possible,' the spokesperson said.   Travel
 agents are taking advantage of the loophole in the travel ban by 
selling 14-day travel packages to go-between countries such as 
Dubai.       One package included a stay in a four-star hotel, a personal guide and face masks.    Foreign
 nationals - excluding permanent Australian residents - who have been in
 mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from 
the time they left China.    Universities Australia, which 
represents tertiary institutions, told Daily Mail Australia that Deputy 
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly advised universities that students who 
had been in a third country for more than 14 days would be 
welcomed.      'Students can only travel to Australia
 when health officials deem it safe, and universities will continue to 
comply with all of that advice,' said Universities Australia Chief 
Executive Catriona Jackson.   As of Saturday, there were 77,275 confirmed cases worldwide of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus.   In
 the e-mail being circulated online this week, Western Sydney University
 said the $1500 payment would be made after arrival in Australia   Of those cases, 63,088 were in the worst-affected Chinese province of Hubei, BNO News reported.    The
 Government has said it will only ease the travel restrictions on 
medical advice if Chinese case numbers outside of Hubei province do not 
show a 'material increase'.   The Australian Health Protection 
Principal Committee, which medically advises the Government on its 
COVID-19 travel ban, said on Thursday that the government could relax 
its ban temporarily for tertiary students as long as they agreed to 
isolate themselves when in Australia.   'Universities would need to 
provide appropriate advice to students and support students to access 
health services if symptoms develop,' the committee said.   It is 
unclear how university students could isolate themselves in Australia 
while at the same time needing to attend their classes.   As of noon
 on Saturday, confirmed case numbers outside Hubei province had risen to
 1333 in China's Guangdong province, 1267 in Henan province,  1204 
in Zhejiang province and 396 in the capital Beijing, according to BNO 
News which has been tracking the virus in depth since the outbreak 
began.   Of the 75,893 people with COVID-19 in mainland China, 11,633 were in a serious condition, BNO News said.   Health
 workers in Australia are concerned about the strain an outbreak would 
put on the country's already-stretched public hospital 
resources.     The highly-infectious virus is able to 
spread even when those infected do not show symptoms making it difficult
 to stop and because the virus is new to humans, nobody has any 
immunity.    A report from the Chinese Centre for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CCDCP) which analysed more than 44,000 people 
with COVID-19 found 14 per cent of those who catch it suffer severe 
symptoms including pneumonia, the BBC reported.   Five per cent of 
those who catch it become critically ill, the BBC reported, meaning they
 require complex intensive care in hospital.   The virus has an 
overall death rate of 2.3 per cent, with those aged over 60 the worst 
affected according to the CCDCP.       NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15           "

 at the University of Queensland are making a fast-tracked attempt to 
make a cure for the disease, which has killed more than 2,200 people 
worldwide.   There are now dozens of Australians suffering from the 
respiratory disease, with 47 contracting it on the Diamond Princess 
cruise ship in  Japan .   Working
 with the global Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations 
rapid response program, Australian researchers have now met a key 
milestone in their vaccine effort.   Specialists have spent 
weeks working on a vaccine for coronavirus, after it killed more than 
2,200 people worldwide. Scientists are seen working at a laboratory in 
France   Coronavirus (pictured) has infected tens of thousands of people across the globe, killing more than 2,200 so far   They are trying to develop the first life-saving vaccine for coronavirus, which has been renamed COVID-19.   Its first attempt is now ready, and will soon be tested.      'There
 is still extensive testing to ensure that the vaccine candidate is safe
 and creates an effective immune response,' the university's 
Vice-Chancellor Peter Hoj said.    'But the technology and the dedication of these researchers means the first hurdle has been passed.'   A

 Molecular Biosciences, said they had used the same technology as had 
helped developed vaccines for Ebola, MERS coronavirus and Nipah.   'But this technology is also designed to be able to quickly respond to a currently unknown virus,' Dr Chappell explained.    'We've
 put together a group of some of Australia's leading academic 
institutions, with the goal of reducing the time required for vaccine 
development down from multiple years to a matter of weeks.'   Work is being done at laboratories across the world, including this one in Paris (pictured)   The disease has infected more than 75,500 in China, and another 1,150 people across the world in 27 other countries.    Earlier
 on Saturday, two more Australians were diagnosed with the deadly virus

hospitals in Victoria.   Two Queensland women aged 54 and 55 also 
tested positive on Friday night for the infection after leaving the ship
 on Thursday and will be flown to a Brisbane hospital on Saturday for 
further treatment.   Six Australians have tested positive for coronavirus after being taken off the ship.   A

 as safe as a large car if the two collide? So, does size matter in a 
collision?   This was sparked by a conversation with some friends 
the other day when I asked about whether crash ratings factored in their
 thinking when buying a new car. One said, yes, but most said, no, and 
one even asked what ANCAP was.   But all my mates agreed that if 
youare driving a small car with a five-star rating and collide with a 
larger vehicle with a five-star rating then the crash rating means 
nothing and that size is everything. But is it as cut-and-dried as all 
that?   Well, no. It isnat. Occupant safety in a collision comes down to a 
range of factors whether the vehicle is big or small, like the age of 
the vehicle, its active and passive safety, the engineering of its 
crumple zones and so on.   To get started, we looked at what the 
Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC)had to saya|only it 
didnat have much to say on the matter. Rather, its authors looked at the
 research around size and weight in a collision context and concluded 
that more work needed to be done before a definitive conclusion could be
 reached.   Hereas some of what it summarised, aThe literature on 
the crashworthiness relationship between vehicle mass, size and safety 
is rather ambiguous. There was general consensus by most authors that 
bigger cars were inherently more safe than smaller ones in a collision. 
However, trying to define this relationship more precisely from the 
literature is problematic, in part, because of the number of confounding
 influences and definitional differencesa.   Okay. So, still no 
clearer. What else did MUARC find? aIt was concluded in general terms 
that mass is probably a more important safety feature than size for most
 car-to-car collisions, although there was a suggestion that size may 
predominate more in rollover crashes and single-vehicle accidents 
generally.a     Related Slideshow: 14 easy car hacks you should know (Provided by Photo Services)      
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
   From using toothpaste to clean headlights to fixing dents with a plunger, here are some hacks to care for your car.   If you want to make the hazy 
headlights of your car sparkling, use toothpaste. Apply the toothpaste 
on an old towel or a rag and rub it on the surface and before you know 
it, your dingy-looking headlight will be shining again.   Do you cringe each time you open the 
car door inside the garage because there just isnat enough space? Fret 
not. Protect the door (and the wall) with a swimming pool noodle. Halve 
the noodle lengthwise and stick it to the wall; the foam will cushion 
the impact of the door and make sure there are no more dings (or dents).   Constant exposure to grime, dust and 
water can damage windshield wiper blades. In case you havenat gotten 
around to installing new ones and are unexpectedly caught in rain, cover
 the damaged blade with a pair of womenas stockings and you are good to 
drive off again.   Scratches and chipped paint expose 
the metal frame of your car to rust and decay. To avoid this, use nail 
polish of the same (or nearly) shade to touch up the damaged bits.   Here is another car hack you can 
accomplish with nail paint. In the event of a broken windshield, paint 
clear nail polish on both sides of the glass to stave off cracking until
 you get it replaced. Remember, this only works with small cracks.   Did you wake up after a massive 
snowstorm to find your car covered under a blanket of snow? Instead of 
spending time scraping ice off the windshield on a winter morning, just 
spray a mixture of water (one part) and vinegar (three parts) and hey 
presto, no more snow. You can also spray the solution the night before.   During summers, the intense heat can 
heat up the steering wheel and seat belt. Here is a quick-fix solution 
to help you in such situations. Simply spray some water on the steering 
wheel and seat belt; evaporation helps in cooling the car interior.   A plunger may be a plumberas helper 
but it is just as useful to repair minor dents. All you have to do is 
wet the dent and the plunger, and then push and pull until the damage is
 undone.   Clean up the gummy mess left behind 
by parking permits or bumper stickers by placing a wet newspaper on the 
affected spot for 15-20 minutes. The newspaper softens the glue, making 
it easier to wipe away the sticky residue.   On a hot day, chances are your car 
will end up like an oven if it is not parked in shade. However, instead 
of blasting the air conditioning, try this trick to cool down the car. 
Roll down one window and then open and close the car door in quick 
succession five to six times. The action forces the hot air out of the 
car and the cooler breeze wafts in through the open window.   Another car trouble that snowy 
winters often bring is the freezing of car locks. Keep a water-less hand
 sanitizer at hand and, when such a situation arises, apply some of that
 solution on the key. The alcohol content in the sanitizer helps in 
melting the ice.   Keeping cars clean can be quite a 
task. Coffee filters a made of minute particles a soak up dirt pretty 
fast, making car cleaning a somewhat easier task. Dab a few drops of 
vegetable or olive oil on the coffee filter and wipe clean.   Though there are a variety of 
carriers and consoles in the market to provide in-car storage solutions,
 that shouldnat stop you from putting your own creative spin. You can 
hang a shoe organizer from the back of a car seat to help carry books or
 bottles, or attach a mesh bungee net from the ceiling to hang your coat
 or dress. To hold engine and motor oils, you can use a shower caddy.   When you are pressed for time, coffee
 on the go is always a great idea. But is the condensation from the 
container leaving a mess in your car cup holder? Fret not. All you have 
to do is place a silicone cupcake liner in the holder. The liner will 
soak up the condensation as well as guard your cup holders against dust 
particles.    15/15 SLIDES 
   And then there was this gem MUARC stumbled across. aThe level of 
restraint has been shown to have a marked influence on the mass (size) 
and safety relationship. One study reported that an unbelted driver in a
 2000kg car had the same amount of protection as a belted driver in a 
1140kg car. It was further claimed that drivers of small cars gained 
more from being restrained than those of larger ones. It is too early 
yet to confirm if there is any disproportionate benefit of driver 
airbags by vehicle sizea.   So, there clearly hasnat been a lot done
 in determining whether youare safer in a bigger than a smaller vehicle 
in a collision, only thatas not exactly true. PM did some more digging 
and found some good information. According to Michael Paine, Technical 
Manager at ANCAP, aGenerally speaking big cars will do better in a 
collision with a smaller car. This is a result of the physics of the 
crash, where the heavier object will experience a lower deceleration and
 therefore lower forces on the occupantsa Michael says. aBut if your car
 hits a larger stationary object, then thereas a lot more weight in a 
larger car, which means more crash energy to deal with.a   So, this 
is making more sense, right. But thereas still more to it than simply 
saying bigger is better. And thatas largely because none of the safety 
data explores the effect of one vehicle on another vehicle. It merely 
explores the safety of the vehicle tested in relation to a stationary 
object. Sure, this is good for comparing apples with apples, as long as 
youare comparing small car results with small car resultsa|and 
considering performance in a stationary collision event.   Researchers
 at the Berkley Labas Environmental Energy Technologies Division looked 
at acombined riska and thatas really what weare talking about when weare
 asking whether bigger is better in a collision. Now, so you know, the 
research conducted looked mid-1990s vehicles. One of the researchers, 
Tom Wenzel, said, a""We focused on the risk not only to occupants of the 
vehicle model in question in all types of crashes, but also on the risk 
to the drivers of other vehicles involved in crashes with the model in 
question.""   In the report, the authors determined that SUVs werenat
 any safer for their drivers than the aaveragea medium or large car and 
not much safer than many compact and subcompact cars.   Be that as 
it may, bigger sometimes is abettera as previously explained by ANCAPas 
Michael Paine. And, in 2009, the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, 
the US version of ANCAP, studied the effects of crashing larger cars 
into smaller cars, and concluded, aWhen a car crashes into a solid 
barrier, the outcome depends in part on the size of the front end. If 
one caras front end is long enough to crush twice as much as another 
caras in a barrier crash at the same speed, its restrained occupants 
will experience half as much force as the people in the smaller car 
because it takes them twice as long to stop.   aWhen two cars going 
the same speed crash front to front, the outcome depends in part on the 
carsa relative weights. The heavier car will push the lighter car 
backward during the impact, which means the velocity change of the 
heavier car will be much less than that of the lighter car. If the 
lighter car weighs half as much as the heavier car, the forces on its 
occupants will be twice as great.a   Yep, this is all pure physics. 
But weare still not talking about occupant safety. See, the development 
of crumple zones and vehicle crash structures, airbags and even things 
like multi-collision braking can have a huge effect when weare talking 
about a bigger vehicle hitting a smaller one.   But thereas still 
more to the discussion. For instance, what if youare in an older, 
heavier type of 4x4 and you hit a lighter more modern vehicle with a 
crumple zone. Who will come off better? The passengers in the heavier 
4x4 or those in the lighter vehicle with a more sophisticated crash 
structure?   Well, we donat have to wonder because Fifth Gear, about
 10 years ago, did just that. It took a Series II Land Rover Discovery 
and crashed it into a current-at-the-time Renault Espace (now, the last 
generation model). The test was a slight offset collision at 40mph. The 
occupants in the Espace were better off than those in the older 
Discovery. If you go by the claims that a heavier vehicle with a longer 
bonnet (the Discovery) will perform better than that of something 
lighter with a smaller bonnet (Renault Espace) then the Espace didnat 
stand a chance.   And the result? Looking at the wrecked vehicles 
you could clearly see the Espaceas crumple zone had worked perfectly in 
absorbing the energy and impact while the vehicleas passenger cell 
remained relatively intact with the front and rear airbags firing to 
further protect the occupants and the impact deflected along the 
vehicle's sill, A-pillar and roof. In the Land Rover, however, the solid
 main chassis member didnat budge sending the shock of the impact 
cannoning through the rest of the vehicle causing the vehicle to crush 
and deform as the Espace was forced around that rail and into the softer
 parts of the Discovery. Indeed, the Discoveryas dashboard and steering 
wheel ended up crushing the legs of the crash test dummy, the door 
creased and the passenger cell buckled.   That was head on, but what
 about if one had been crashed into the other in a T-bone scenario? 
Well, the IIHS tested for those sorts of things and found that older 
4x4s with a ahighera physical structure posed a greater safety risk to 
those in a smaller car because the vehicleas main structure would act 
like a battering ram.   So, in our above example of the Discovery 
and Espace collision, itas likely the Discovery would have had the 
potential to do more damage in a side-on collision because of the height
 of its main chassis rails, but the Discovery would still have suffered 
in the collision because of its lack of energy absorption which still 
would have transferred onto the rest of the vehicle. The Espace 
occupants would likely still have fared better due to the side airbags 
and strength of the passenger cell and its ability to absorb and deflect
 energy.   Recent tests by the IIHS have shown those driving modern 
4x4s pose less risk to those in smaller cars, in side-on collisions 
because the physical structure is now lower and stronger passenger cells
 and side airbags have improved occupant safety.   So, while bigger 
is sometimes better thereas more to it than that, like the age of the 
vehicle, its passenger cell construction and strength, its 
energy-absorbing crumple zones, how the collision occurs, and so on. So,
 never look at a heavily crumpled car and think it performed poorly, 
look at the passenger cell and how the impact affected the occupants, 
because itas likely the vehicle crumpled to absorb energy and protect 
the occupants. So, is big better in a vehicle collision? No, not always,
 but there's still always a but and in this case it would be if an 
older, heavier 4x4 collided head-on with, say, a medium car. The 4x4 
would likely ride up and over the bonnet of the medium car with its 
stiffer chassis members battering the smaller vehicle.   But where 
modern vehicles are concerned the differences become much smaller. This 
is a complicated topic and not so cut-and-dried as my mates would have 
thought.

1458523060,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8035767/Pauline-Hanson-slams-Chinese-students-exploiting-loophole-beat-coronavirus-travel-ban.html,2020-02-23,Pauline Hanson slams Chinese students floating coronavirus travel ban," Politician  Pauline Hanson  has slammed Chinese students for exploiting a legal loophole to sneak back into Australia amid the coronavirus outbreak.   She
 called for universities to be liable if other students catch the 
disease, saying officials only care about 'money from foreign 
students'.    A travel ban is in place to keep Australians safe from the deadly disease, which has killed more than 2,000 people worldwide.   It
 means travellers, including students, are not allowed to enter 
Australia if they have been in China in the previous 14 days.    But
 students from China are finding ways to work around the ban, brought in
 by Scott Morrison, with 1,477 students flying in on Friday and Saturday
 alone.   Thousands more are expected in the coming week, with 
students arriving in Australia via transit countries such as 
Malaysia.    A family wearing face masks to protect themselves from coronavirus arrive in Brisbane Airport before the ban (pictured)   'If
 any Australian kid catches coronavirus from any of these foreign 
students that come here, will the university be held liable?', Ms 
Hanson, who is leader of One Nation and a senator for Queensland, said.   'We know that the universities in Australia are not for the Australian students.     'It is all for foreign students and they rely on that, that money coming into the country.      'They
 use it as back door to get their permanent residency to Australia and 
then they send their own kids out here to get the free education.    'It is disgraceful what is happening.'      Pauline Hanson (pictured on Monday on Today) said there is a danger of Australians catching coronavirus from Chinese students   Passengers arriving in Australia are required under Australian law to identify themselves and provide certain information.   When you arrive in Australia from a foreign country, you are given a passenger card to fill in.   One of the boxes asks for the name of the 'country in which you boarded the flight'.   But this Chinese student wrote 'Hong Kong' in this section, despite starting his journey in China.   With this, he claims authorities did not question him and simply waved him through.   If he had written 'China' in the box, he would have been stopped and questioned.     Speaking
 on Today on Monday morning, she said universities shouldn't be helping 
Chinese students get back to Australia to continue their studies.   Daily
 Mail Australia exposed the worrying loophole earlier this month and 
alerted the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force 
to the breach, but did they did not respond to requests for 
comment.    One student bragged to friends  about how he flouted the coronavirus travel ban, putting thousands in danger of contracting the deadly disease.     He admitted to lying to officials by claiming he arrived from Hong Kong, when he in fact flew to Sydney from mainland China.   Ms Hanson also used her Today appearance to defended controversial comments about the horrific  Brisbane  murder-suicide, saying 'these things happen'.   In a  crime  which
 rocked Australia on Wednesday, Hannah Clarke, 31, was murdered by her 
estranged husband along with her three young children.   Aaliyah, 6,
 Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3, were burned alive by their own father on their
 way to school after he poured petrol in their car and lit a flame.   But
 Ms Hanson said the cowardly murders shouldn't lead to people 
'bastardising all men' - saying Baxter could have been 'driven to it'.   'Don't bastardise all men out there, or women for that matter, because these things happen,' she said on Monday morning.   Speaking
 about domestic violence murders, she added that: 'A lot of people are 
driven to this, to do these acts for one reason or another.'   The 
killings have led to calls for more protection for domestic violence 
victims, after Ms Clarke was emotionally, sexually and financially 
abused by Baxter for years.    Speaking on Today, Ms Hanson 
said the murders have been in the news more than if it was committed by a
 woman - and that Baxter may have been 'driven to it'.   Lloyd
 and Suzanne Clarke (pictured), parents to Hannah Clarke, break down at a
 vigil to remember their murdered daughter on Sunday   'You 
know, this has been for a week we have been in the news nearly every day
 about this horrific tragedy,' she said on Today on Monday 
morning.     'But we don't hear much about it when a woman
 has murdered her children by driving a  car into a tree, she 
threw out a suicide note.    'Or the woman who doused her husband with fuel and set him alight an said she was possibly driven to it.    'Hopefully the family law inquiry will get to the bottom of it.'   Hannah
 Clarke and her three children were torched in their car on Wednesday 
morning by Rowan Baxter (all pictured together) who stabbed himself to 
death at the scene in Camp Hill   On Thursday morning dozens of family and friends visited the scene of the tragedy to pay tribute to the family (pictured)   She defended commentator Bettina Arndt, who made controversial comments about the Baxter murders.    Hannah Clarke (pictured, left) with Baxter (right) on their wedding day    Some
 MPs want Arndt to be stripped of her Order of Australia, after she 
praised a Queensland police officer for saying Baxter may have been 
'driven too far'.   Queensland detective Mark Thompson was taken off the case after making the comments.    'Congratulations
 to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper 
evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 
'driven too far',' Ms Arndt wrote on Twitter.   'But note the 
misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of 
seeking excuses and explanations when women stab their partners to 
death, or drive their children into dams but immediately judging a man 
in these circumstances as simply representing the evil violence that is 
in all men.'   Rowan Charles Baxter (pictured, centre right, with his children) murdered his three kids in a horrific car fire on Wednesday   Speaking about Ms Arndt's comments, Ms Hanson said she should not be stripped of her Australia Day honour.   'It was a horrendous act of what he did to his children,' she said.    'It was a tragedy and I am very deeply sorry for everyone.    'Family and friends involved in this treacherous of what he did to his former wife and his children.    'But
 Bettina Arndt should not be stripped of her Order of Australia. She is 
clearly stating what she thinks and what a police officer said.    Hannah Clarke (pictured with daughters Aaliyah and Laianah) was killed just months after breaking free from her abusive husband   'This is why I have pushed for the family law inquiry to get behind what is happening on this.'   Her comments come as a close friend of Hannah described her courageous last moments after  she was ambushed and burned alive by her estranged husband.       Simon
 Farmer - a family friend who was with Hannah in the Intensive Care Unit
 when she died after suffering burns to 97 per cent of her body - 
described the devoted mother's final minutes alive in gut-wrenching 
detail.   'She hung in there ... Until the last heartbeat brought a tidal wave of grief and anger,' he wrote on social media.   'You should all know how strong she was, she fought so hard.'   The three youngsters died at the scene.    Their father then killed himself beside the car when he knew his evil deed was done.    The Baxter family car (pictured) was set on fire in Camp Hill, Brisbane, on Wednesday February 19   Queensland

 David Beard shared the 31-year-old's dreams of becoming a police 
officer at a vigil held on Sunday evening in Brisbane to mourn the loss 
of the family-of-four.   Hannah had spoken about her plans at a 
Police Citizens Youth Club while visiting a friend the day before she 
burned to death.    The shocking murder-suicide that has
 left Australia reeling unfolded just metres from the home of Ms 
Clarke's parents on Raven Street, Camp Hill, as she drove her children 
to school   Hannah Clarke (pictured) with her 'main man', her son Trey, in a beach snap   The
 mum-of-three had desperately tried to keep her young family safe from 
their evil dad, but was struggling after her domestic violence 
protection order was watered down.     It has since 
emerged that he subject Hannah to years of domestic violence, prompting 
the brave mum to finally leave him last November.   There was a 
domestic violence order (DVO) in place, but she expressed frustration 
that the conditions wouldn't be enough to keep her family safe.   Despite
 being stalked every day by her monstrous ex, the DVO was watered down 
to allow her husband to be a close as 100 metres from her.

 Neil Mitchell has accused the Australian government of 'selling its 
national dignity' by allowing Chinese students to bypass the  coronavirus  travel ban.   Foreign students trying to fly from the Chinese mainland to Australia to study can travel v ia a third country - thereby staying outside China for the required two weeks.    Western
 Sydney University also told its students last week it would subsidise 
$1500 in travel and accommodation costs for them to travel through a 
third country.     Travellers are pictured wearing 
protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport on January 
29.  Broadcaster Neil Mitchell said Australia was 'selling its 
national dignity' by allowing Chinese students to get around the travel 
ban   Speaking on his  3AW Mornings  radio show, Mitchell said Australia was 'kowtowing to China' by allowing students to get around the ban.   'We
 need Chinese businesses, but at the moment we are selling out our 
national dignity, we are selling out our principles. There is no 
national pride,' he said.   'We've got to choose between what's right and what makes a dollar, and at the moment the dollar is winning.   Mitchell also accused the Australian government of celebrating China's record on human rights.   ''Let's celebrate their atrocities"", that's what we're doing. ""Let's celebrate their abuse of human rights,""' he added.   He
 also referred to the news that Australian swimmer Mack Horton's old 
school - Caulfield Grammar in Melbourne - had shelved plans to name a 
new swimming pool complex after him.   Mitchell said the 
travel ban was in place for a reason and Australia had to choose 
'between what's right and what makes a dollar'   We say weare a proud country. We say we stand up for ourselves, donat bow to anybody - well, nobody but China.   Australia is into a full on cultural cringe now, kowtowing to China.   Itas
 based around the coronavirus and money. We donat want to offend China 
and risk losing their students, their market, their buying power.   We
 need Chinese businesses, but at the moment we are selling out our 
national dignity, we are selling out our principles. There is no 
national pride    Weave got to choose between whatas right and what makes a dollar, and at the moment the dollar is winning.    Potentially, that threatens our health.    Weave allowed students to get around the travel ban and come here regardless    Western
 Sydney University is even giving those students $1500 each so they can 
go through a third country transit to get around the travel 
ban     Letas celebrate their atrocities, thatas what weare doing. Letas celebrate their abuse of human rights    None
 of this is aimed at the Chinese people. I am criticising their 
government, I am criticising our government, I am certainly criticising 
the Mack Horton decision.    Two out of those three criticisms would have me locked up in China and never heard of again.    'Caulfield
 Grammar stood with the cheats, all because of a dollar! They've got a 
campus in China and they've got Chinese students, so decency ran 
second,' Mitchell said.   Horton refused to join Chinese rival Sun Yang on the podium at the swimming world championships in  South Korea  last year, and previously labelled him a 'drug cheat' at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.     One Nation leader  Pauline Hanson  also slammed Chinese students for exploiting a legal loophole to sneak back into Australia.   She
 called for universities to be liable if other students catch the 
disease, saying officials only care about 'money from foreign 
students'.    Western Sydney University (pictured) told 
its international students it would subside the cost of airfares and 
accommodation to allow them to reach Australia through a third country   Politician
 Pauline Hanson (pictured on the Today show on Monday morning)  has
 also slammed Chinese students for exploiting a legal loophope to sneak 
back into Australia   In the space of two days on Friday and 
Saturday nearly 1,500 Chinese students used the exception in government 
rules to fly to Australia.   The Australian government's ban on 
those coming from mainland China was extended last week until February 
29, affecting an estimated 65,000 Chinese students.     The
 ban can be dodged though by going through a country which does not have
 a travel ban on travellers from China - including Thailand, 
Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and Japan.    The University of Adelaide is meanwhile offering a care package worth about $5000 to about 3000 Chinese students.    The
 package includes a 20 per cent discount on semester one tuition fees 
and up to $2000 towards airfares which they can access only once the 
travel ban is lifted.    It also offered online study help 
including videos of lectures, peer networking support and library 
resources so Chinese students who cannot be on campus by the March 26 
start date, so can keep up with their courses 
remotely.          NEW SOUTH WALES: 4        January 25     January 27       VICTORIA: 6      January 25     January 29     January 30     February 1       February 22           QUEENSLAND: 8      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21        JAPAN: 15              Advertisement    "

Traveller Coffee owners it will sting them with fines if their customers
 continue to use benches situated directly across the road from 
it.    Becco Restaurant, on Crossley Street at the top end of 
Melbourne - has placed signs on the benches asking people not to sit on

 Coffee is packed each morning as Melburnians gather for a hot or cold 
brew from its little cafe on Crossley Street    The signs are directed at the coffee lovers who line-up outside the popular cafe to get their morning brew.    On Monday, customers stood and clogged the narrow street with no-one daring to sit on the wooden benches.    Customers have told Daily Mail Australia the situation had become ridiculous over recent weeks.    'It's
 just mean spirited,' one customer said. 'I mean it's one thing to ask 
people not to sit there when it's open, but the place doesn't open until
 midday.'   But the restaurant appears to have the support of 
Melbourne City Council, which has warned the cafe to keep its customers 
off its neighbour's seats.     One worker, who wished to 
remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia council staff had visited 
the cafe after receiving complaints from Becco.    Traveller

Traveller's Coffee can be seen standing in the street just down the road
 from the iconic Pellegrini's Espresso Bar   'They told us to keep our customers off the benches, even when they're not open, otherwise we face penalties,' he said.    Customers believe the bench saga is a direct attack on Melbourne's coffee culture.     Traveller
 Coffee is located just metres from Melbourne's iconic Pelligrini 
Espresso Bar, which put Melbourne on the coffee map thanks to co-owner 
Sisto Malaspina.   Mr Malaspina, 74, died in 2018 after he was 
attacked by 30-year-old Somali-born Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, who crashed
 his vehicle loaded with gas bottles in the Melbourne CBD, stabbing 
three people, before he was shot dead by police.    'Sisto would be turning in his grave,' a cold brew-sipping office worker told Daily Mail Australia.     Two
 weeks before he died,  Monash journalism student Nishant 
Kulkarni interviewed Mr Malaspina, who spoke of the brew's importance to
 Melbourne.   'You just have a coffee to keep you company, itas like a companion, itas like a friend,' he said at the time.    'Our coffee is more than nourishment to the body, itas nourishment to the soul.'    Such was Melbourne's love and respect for the coffee icon, he was given a state funeral.    Coffee

to sit on wooden benches outside Becco. Coffee lovers have been told to 
sit elsewhere even when the restaurant is closed   Becco calls itself a 'Melbourne legend' with 'outside seating down the very New York style laneway'.   At
 his service, Reverend monsignor Greg Bennet said Mr Malaspinaas 
customers would always cherish their hospitality experiences long after 
the espresso cup was left on the counter.   'A cup of coffee, served with joy, with warmth, humour and concern can truly make the world a better place,' he said.   Traveller
 Coffee is no stranger to the bustling Melbourne coffee scene and has 
been  serving hot and cold brews from its Crossley Street location 
since 2013.    In addition to Melbourne's warm favourites, Traveller has enjoyed a cult following for its cold creations.    Such is the popularity of its Seven Seeds Espresso Blend that it now sells cans and four litre casks of its cold brew.    The
 cafe shares a warm regard among Melburnians for its friendly staff and 
eco-friendly ways, which allows customers to return coffee bean 
canisters.     Meanwhile Becco describes itself as a 'Melbourne legend'.   'Great
 for lunch, dinner or drinks at our fabulous bar, with outside seating 
down the very New York style laneway,' its website states.    'A buzzy vibe, with warm lighting for intimate occasions, award winning modern Italian food, and an extensive wine list.'    A spokeswoman for Melbourne City Council confirmed it had intervened.     'The
 City of Melbourne has received complaints from Becco management, 
regarding the use of their private property from patrons of neighbouring
 cafes, specifically Travellers Coffee, who have reportedly left rubbish
 and spills on their in-built outdoor seating,' she said.    'City
 of Melbourne Local Laws officers have spoken to Traveller Coffee owners
 and advised them to inform their customers that they are not permitted 
to use the Becco tables and chairs.'    Daily Mail Australia has contacted Becco and Traveller for comment.   "

 (COVID-19) outbreaks have continued to expand in South Korea and Italy 
over the last week. As of Monday, there were at least 77,150 confirmed 
in mainland China, where the virus originated, bringing the global total
 to more than 79,000. In some places, coronavirus has also proven 
deadly, with the death toll currently sitting at 2,620.   But is there a cure for coronavirus? Is there a vaccine that can help prevent people getting the virus, stopping its widespread?   A
 vaccine to prevent coronavirus is yet to exist, but Professor Stephen 
Turner from Monash University, said there are a now a number of 
initiatives that are aiming to develop new vaccines for the COVID-19 
virus.   This includes the CEPI initiative (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation).   So how easy it for a vaccine to be developed?

 Turner said: aIn principle, it is relatively straight forward to design
 and do preclinical testing of novel vaccine platforms, there are many 
new technologies being developed.   aThe difficulty is getting such platforms into humans. There are many steps before any vaccine is approved for human use.   aIt has to be shown to be safe, as well as effective.a   How
 long it will take for a vaccine to be administered is a hard question 
according to Professor Turner, as it depends on any vaccine candidate 
meeting regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy and cost 
effectiveness.    DON'T MISS    He 
added: aThere is the capacity to fast track experimental vaccines where 
there is a really public health need/public health imperative.   aThere is a recent example of rapid testing of a new Ebola virus vaccine.a   So who will be first to get the vaccine?   First
 responders, health care workers and public health officials will most 
likely be first in line to get the vaccine to help treat those infected.           Coronavirus cure: A vaccine is to exist but scientists are currently trying to develop one  (Image: GETTY)     Professor
 Turner added: aItas then likely those most at risk from COVID-19 to be 
given the vaccine, for example the elderly and those with underlying 
issues such as respiratory/cardiovascular problems.a   Coronavirus has three main symptoms, these are:   The NHS is advising you call 111 if youave been:           Coronavirus cure: Wash your hands with soap and water often to help prevent the spread of the virus  (Image: GETTY)     You

111, stay indoors and avoid close contact with other people.   As
 thereas currently no vaccine for coronavirus, the NHS is also advising 
things you should do to avoid catching or spreading germs.   The health body says you should:   You shouldnat touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.  "

determined their level of physical self-worth experienced lower sexual 
satisfaction.          Image published for representational purposes only.  Photograph: A still from  Love Sex Aur Dhoka     A new research suggests that most women remain unhappy and stressed 
about their sex lives with at least one in five of them suffering from 
female sexual dysfunction.   The study was conducted by the researchers of Monash University and was published in the journal  Fertility &amp; Sterility .   According to the study, half of young Australian women experience 
sexually-related personal distress, with one in five women having at 
least one female sexual dysfunction (FSD).   The study conducted by the Women's Health Research Program at Monash 
University has reported, for the first time, an overall picture of the 
sexual wellbeing of Australian women between the ages of 18 and 39.   Results showed 50.2 per cent of young Australian women experienced 
some form of sexually-related personal distress. This relates to the 
degree of feeling guilty, embarrassed, stressed or unhappy about their 
sex lives.   A concerning 29.6 per cent of women experienced sexually-related 
personal distress without dysfunction, and 20.6 per cent had at least 
one FSD.   The most common FSD was low sexual self-image, which caused distress 
for 11 per cent of study participants. Arousal, desire, orgasm and 
responsiveness dysfunction affected 9 per cent, 8 per cent, 7.9 per cent
 and 3.4 per cent of the study cohort respectively.   Sexual self-image dysfunction was associated with being overweight, 
obese, living together with partner, not married, married and 
breastfeeding.   Taking psychotropic medication (such as antidepressants), reported by
 20 per cent of surveyed women, had the most pervasive impact on sexual 
function. The use of the combined oral contraceptive pill was not 
associated with any sexual dysfunction.   ""Sexual wellbeing is recognised as a fundamental human right. It is 
of great concern that one in five young women have an apparent sexual 
dysfunction and half of all women within this age group experience 
sexually-related personal distress,"" said the lead researcher Susan 
Davis.   ""This is a wake-up call to the community and signals the importance 
of health professionals being open and adequately prepared to discuss 
young women's sexual health concerns.""   The Grollo-Ruzzene Foundation Younger Women's Health Study, funded by
 Grollo Ruzzene Foundation, recruited 6986 women aged 18 to 39 years, 
living in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, to take part in the 
study.   As a part of the study, all women completed a questionnaire that 
assessed their sexual wellbeing in terms of desire, arousal, 
responsiveness, orgasm, and self-image. Participants also evaluated 
whether they had sexually-associated personal distress and provided 
extensive demographic information.   Almost one-third of participants described themselves as single, 47 
per cent had a body mass index within the normal range, and nearly 70 
per cent had reported being sexually active in the 30 days preceding the
 study.   Women who habitually monitored their appearance, and for whom 
appearance determined their level of physical self-worth, reported being
 less sexually assertive and more self-conscious during intimacy and 
experienced lower sexual satisfaction.   Professor Davis said if untreated, sexually-related personal distress
 and FSD could impact relationships and overall quality of life as women
 aged.   ""The high prevalence of sexually-related personal distress signals 
the importance of health professionals, particularly those working in 
the fields of gynaecology and fertility, being adequately prepared to 
routinely ask young women about any sexual health concerns, and to have 
an appropriate management or referral pathway in place,"" added Davis.  "

 Melbourne councils will have to refund almost $20 million in parking 
fines after it was found they unlawfully outsourced their review process
 to a private company.   Glen Eira, Port Phillip and Stonnington 
councils will refund more than 200,000 fines after Victorian Ombudsman 
Deborah Glass found they acted illegally when subcontracting challenged 
parking fine reviews to Tenix.   The fines were issued between 2006
 and 2016 and take in popular areas including St Kilda and the Chapel 
Street shopping precinct.   ""The legal issues have not been tested 
in court, so I cannot definitely determine the lawfulness of the 
councils' actions,"" Ms Glass said on Tuesday.   ""But I can express my opinion, which is that the three councils acted contrary to law.""   Ms Glass said the law ""strongly suggests"" internal reviews must be decided by the issuing agency.   The three councils disagree with the Ombudsman's findings but will refund the fines anyway.   They
 argue officials still had the final say over each fine review, but Ms 
Glass found they ""rubber-stamped"" the contractor's recommendations.   In one example, a council officer approved 107 recommendations from a private contractor from 107 fines in just one minute.   ""The suggestion that council officers were making genuine decisions on the evidence was simply not credible,"" Ms Glass said.   ""It
 is also apparent that none of the three councils disclosed who was 
making internal review decisions, each of them providing a similar 
squiggle by an anonymous officer.""   It comes after Kingston and 
Monash councils announced last year they would repay 46,000 fines 
amounting to $4.9 million because of similar issues.   In a 
statement, Glen Eira Council said the issue had been ""vexed by multiple 
and conflicting legal opinions and unclear communications"" from the 
state government.   ""While we have always held the view that we 
were conducting reviews lawfully, we have welcomed the Ombudsman's 
consideration, and will be guided by her recommendations,"" a spokeswoman
 said.   Both Port Phillip and Stonnington councils believed they 
had acted lawfully and urged the government to remove ""ambiguity"" from 
the Infringements Act.   Shadow Attorney-General Edward O'Donohue 
noted state government agencies also used contractors for similar 
internal reviews and demanded the government identify them publicly.   Premier Daniel Andrews said councils should take action on the Ombudsman's recommendations.   PARKING FINE REFUNDS:   *Glen Eira has more than 36,000 affected fines valued at $3.67 million.   *Port

 councils will have to refund almost $20 million in parking fines after 
it was found they unlawfully outsourced their review process to a 
private company.   Glen Eira, Port Phillip and Stonnington councils in  Melbourne  will refund more than 200,000 fines.   The
 announcement was made after Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass found 
they acted illegally by outsourcing the review of challenged parking 
fines to Tenix.   Three councils in Melbourne (pictured) have
 been forced to refund almost $20 million in parking fines after 
the  Ombudsman found they acted illegally by outsourcing fine 
reviews   The fines were issued between 2006 and 2016 and take
 in popular areas including St Kilda and the Chapel Street shopping 
precinct.   'The legal issues have not been tested in court, so I 
cannot definitely determine the lawfulness of the councils' actions,' Ms
 Glass said on Tuesday.   'But I can express my opinion, which is that the three councils acted contrary to law.'   In
 her report, Ms Glass said the law 'strongly suggests' internal reviews 
must be decided by the agency issuing the infringement.   The three councils have disagreed with the Ombudsman's findings but agreed to refund the fines anyway.   They
 argued officials still had the final say over each fine review, but Ms 
Glass found they 'rubber-stamped' the contractor's recommendations.   In
 one example, a council officer managed to approve 107 recommendations 
from a private contractor from 107 fines in just one minute.   Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass said internal reviews must be decided by the agency issuing the infringement   'The suggestion that council officers were making genuine decisions on the evidence was simply not credible,' Ms Glass said.   'It
 is also apparent that none of the three councils disclosed who was 
making internal review decisions, each of them providing a similar 
squiggle by an anonymous officer.'   It comes after Kingston and 
Monash councils announced last year they would repay 46,000 fines 
because of similar issues to the tune of $4.9 million.   In a 
statement, Glen Eira Council said the issue had been 'vexed by multiple 
and conflicting legal opinions and unclear communications' from the 
state government.   'While we have always held the view that we were
 conducting reviews lawfully, we have welcomed the Ombudsman's 
consideration, and will be guided by her recommendations,' a spokeswoman
 said.   Port Phillip Council said it believed it had acted lawfully
 and urged the government 'to rectify this ambiguity in the 
legislation'.   The refunds will only apply to motorists in the 
affected areas who appealed their infringement between July of 2006 and 
August of 2017.       Advertisement    "

 athletes from the 2020 games.     'Australian athletes 
are ready to make their mark at the Tokyo Olympics - but it should not

The

 of Queensland professor of economics John Quiggin last month estimated 
the bushfires could cost the economy $100billion.    That was before China announced the first cases of coronavirus in the city of Wuhan.   The
 deadly respiratory illness is already threatening Australia's lucrative
 education exports to Chinese international students - an industry worth
 $12billion a year.   A slower world economy would also jeopardise Australia's $51billion worth of iron ore exports to China.     The
 tourism sector, already struggling since the bushfire crisis, is also 
set to suffer from the coronavirus, as fewer people travel 
worldwide.    Qantas has already suspended, until the end of 
May, direct flights from Sydney to Shanghai and on Tuesday, its share 
price tumbled by another 2 per cent .   The double-whammy of 
the bushfire crisis and a likely coronavirus pandemic is set to 
jeopardise the Coalition's election promise of a budget surplus in 2020 -
 which if delivered would be the first since 2007. Pictured are

Securities Exchange lost $53billion, at the worst point of Tuesday 
trade, before the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 finished the day 1.8 per cent
 weaker.   Combined with Monday's losses, the ASX has shed more than $100billion in just two days.    CMC
 Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy said new outbreaks of 
coronavirus in South Korea, Japan and Italy had panicked share markets, 
just five days after the ASX reached a record high.    'We've seen such a dramatic action over the last couple of days,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.   'Investors certainly hit the panic button in trading.'   The
 double-whammy of the bushfire crisis and a likely coronavirus pandemic 
is set to jeopardise the Coalition's election promise of a budget 
surplus in 2020 - which if delivered would be the first since 2007.   The April budget forecast a surplus of $7.1billion for the 2019-20 financial year.   That
 shrunk by 30 per cent to a forecast surplus of $5billion in December, 
even before the bushfires intensified, as Treasury released its Mid-Year
 Economic and Fiscal Outlook.    Prime Minister Scott Morrison 
defended his pre-election promise of a budget surplus - a key element of
 the Coalition winning a third consecutive term in May.        'Hands
 up those who thought there was going to be a coronavirus epidemic when 
the budget was released last May? Of course no one did,' he said in 
Canberra.   The Prime Minister described the virus as an 'unknown global shock'.   'This is not like a global financial crisis. This is a global health crisis,' he said.   ANZ
 head of economics David Plank said the bushfires and the coronavirus 
were likely to cause an economic contraction in the March quarter and 
threaten the government's promise of a surplus budget.   'The 
surplus may have disappeared for this year - in a way that's sort of 
appropriate,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.    'The bushfire will have had some impact, but then the virus will as well.'    Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison (left with Mr Frydenberg), who won a third 
consecutive term for the Coalition in May, defended the earlier promise 
of a budget surplus   Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has
 infected 80,000 worldwide since it originated in December at an animal 
market in Wuhan.    This includes 24 people now in Australia.   Then
 there are another 47 Australians who are among the 219 confirmed cases 
of the coronavirus contracted on board Diamond Princess cruise ship at 
Yokohama in Japan.    Coronavirus has killed more than

 councils in Melbourne will pay back almost $20m in disputed parking 
fines after the Victorian ombudsman found they had acted unlawfully by 
outsourcing the reviews of contested parking fines to a private 
contractor.   Glen Eira city council, Port Phillip city council and 
the City of Stonnington have denied any wrongdoing in their management 
of parking fine reviews, but said they had agreed to pay back any 
reviewed fines issued between 2006 and 2016 or 2017 as a agesture of 
goodwilla.   The ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said all three councils 
had slightly different contractual arrangements with a firm called Tenix
 to review contested parking fines.   In  a report tabled in Victorian parliament on Tuesday ,
 Glass found that all three councils appeared to be in breach of the 
Infringement Act 2006, which gives people who are issued with an 
infringement the right to ask the aenforcement agencya that issued the 
infringement to review its decision.   aThe legal issues have not 
been tested in court; and not being a court, the Ombudsman cannot 
definitively determine the lawfulness of the councilsa actions,a she 
said. aBut I can express an opinion on whether an administrative action 
appears to be contrary to law.a   The act makes no reference to private contractors, and Glass said the definition of aenforcement agencya is unclear.   But
 correspondence from the Department of Justice and Community Safety, 
which administers the act, said that reviews must be conducted by the 
agency that issues the fine.   In a letter to the ombudsman, the 
department said: aThe departmentas communications, provided over many 
years, have consistently advised that an enforcement agency must 
determine internal reviews internally, although contractors can provide 
administrative assistance as part of this process.a   Two other 
Melbourne councils that had contacts with Tenix, Monash city council and
 Kingston city council, last year announced they would pay back 46,000 
parking fines, worth a total of $4.9m, that were reviewed and upheld 
between 2006 and 2016 after determining they had a alegal and morala 
obligation to do so.   Monash city council had earlier written to 
the attorney general to request a retrospective amendment to the act 
allowing for the use of private contractors, but the request was 
refused.   The issue was discovered by a lawyer who ran a website 
called the afine defendera. From 2016, they wrote several letters to 
Melbourne councils disputing the legality of the internal review 
process.   Glass said it was likely that other councils and agencies
 that are authorised to issue infringements in Victoria are also using 
external contractors to conduct internal fine reviews.   Glass found
 that Glen Eira council had outsourced its decision-making on internal 
reviews to Tenix between 2006 and 2016, while Port Phillip and the City 
of Stonnington had ain effect, rubber-stamped the contractor 
recommendationsa.   aCouncil officers could, in principle, review 
the evidence,a Glass wrote. aBut in practice, the speed with which 
recommendations were accepted gave no hint of independent assessment. 
One file review showed a council officer taking one minute to approve 
recommendations for 107 applications, or about half a second per 
application.a   The City of Stonnington said it arejects this 
position entirelya, saying it set clear parameters for internal reviews 
and Tenix had no discretion.   aThe purpose of this arrangement was 
to ensure that efficiency in this process was achieved,a it said in a 
response included in the ombudsmanas report. aCouncil officers were 
still appropriately instructed to review Tenixas recommendations and 
were the ultimate and final decision makers in the process.a  "

 stressed about your sex life is not something uncommon, especially if 
you are from a country like India where sex or any discussion around the
 topic of physical intimacy is still considered a taboo. Again, lack of 
sex education can put a lot of young adults at greater health risk of 
getting infected by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Often, young 
people are given the impression that indulging in a sexual relationship 
before marriage is immoral or those who have multiple sex partners 
should be ashamed of their actions. Under such circumstances, it's no 
wonder that young adults, particularly young women suffer from stress 
related to their sex life. 

   In fact, a study conducted at the Monash University in Australia,
 confirms this. According to the research, that took into account the 
overall picture of the sexual well being of Australian women aged 
between 18 and 39 years, almost half of young women in Australia 
experience some form of sexually-related personal 
distressaembarrassment, guilt and sexual dissatisfaction. Among the many
 sexual distress that young women suffered from, low sexual self-image 
was the most common that caused a lot of stress among women. According 
to experts, the main reason behind a young woman's low sexual self-image
 is the image of 'sexy' women they see between the glossy covers of 
magazines or in movies. People's definition of 'sexy' and what passes as
 a sexually-desirable woman can make any woman feel not 'good enough' to
 meet those standards.
   Besides low sexual self-image, arousal, desire, orgasm and 
responsiveness dysfunction affected 9%, 8 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 3.4
 per cent of the study participants, respectively, revealed the findings
 published in the international journal, Fertility and Sterility.
   
""It is of great concern that one in five young women have an apparent 
sexual dysfunction and half of all women within this age group 
experience sexually-related personal distress. This is a wake-up call to
 the community and signals the importance of health professionals being 
open and adequately prepared to discuss young women's sexual health 
concerns,"" said Susan Davis, senior author and Professor of Women's 
Health at Monash University.

 to spark economic collapse insists she's not paranoid, despite melting 
down jewellery to trade for food, breeding fish to eat, and stockpiling 
weapons in case of a global pandemic.   The woman, who wished to 
remain anonymous, is a self-professed zombie apocalypse movie enthusiast
 from Scenic Rim in south-east Queensland, and has enough food and 
medicine to last a year.   Despite having five pantries brimming 
with 50kg each of rice and lentils, boxes of cereal and bottles of hand 
sanitiser, the mum-of-four said she doesn't think the coronavirus will 
get 'really bad', but believes 'you can never be too safe'.     The family have five pantries brimming with 50kg each of rice and lentils, boxes of cereal and bottles of hand sanitizer   'We've gone a little above and beyond,' she told  news.com.au ,
 detailing her new collection of water filters, camping gear, vegetable 
seeds, dog food, weapons and surplus of paracetamol, antibiotics and 
anti-inflammatory medications.   The 32-year-old said she initially 
started hoarding medicine for her son who takes medication for 
ADHD that is manufactured in China.   She fears that if the Chinese borders aren't re-opened soon, her son will be without medicine.   'If
 it ever did go bad, medicine would be something to trade for, for maybe
 food or something else. Asthma puffers, we've stocked up on them, 
because let's face it, half of Australia has asthma.   The 
32-year-old said she initially started hoarding medicine for her son who
 takes medication for ADHD that is manufactured in China   The family have started a fish breeding program in three large tanks in their living room   'We've
 got about 15 pouches of tobacco so far. It's not a lot but it can still
 be traded for food if need be. Smokers, no matter how crazy it is, will
 still want to smoke.'    She has also melted silver and gold 
jewellery down in case a bartering system becomes the new normal and the
 family need something valuable to trade.   The family has also 
started to research survival skills and natural healing methods, and her
 husband is learning to blacksmith in case forging metal becomes a 
coveted skill in a post-apocalyptic world.   Along with a fish 
breeding program in three large tanks in their living room, the family 
have a full survival plan in case the coronavirus gets out of control in
 Australia.   A Chinese couple wear plastic coats and protective masks as they shop for groceries at a supermarket amid coronavirus fears   While
 the woman admitted it's possible the precautions won't be necessary, 
she said all the items they have collected can still be used.   There have been 22 cases of the coronavirus in Australia.   Ten people have recovered and the others are in a stable condition.   Meanwhile,
 266 people who arrived on a flight from Wuhan on February 9 travelled 
home from Darwin on Monday following 14 days of isolation.   None tested positive for the disease.   Australia
 has imposed a travel entry ban for Chinese passengers, but relaxed the 
rules for Year 11 and 12 students, apart from anyone who remains in the

 Ghebreyesus said the spread of the virus around the world is not yet at
 pandemic stage but acknowledged it has the potential to become 
one.    The WHO no longer uses an official scale to declare a 
pandemic, although spokeswoman Margaret Harris said it will start to use
 the term in communications if it believes a pandemic has been reached.   Speaking
 in Geneva, Dr Ghebreyesus said the focus must still be on containing 
the virus in individual countries, adding that the world is not yet 
seeing 'large-scale severe disease or death'.   He said the WHO was 
'encouraged by the continued decline in cases in China', although more 
than 77,362 cases have been declared there, including 2,618 deaths.   On
 Monday, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned the 
world must prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic. Pictured:

off an ambulance in Hong Kong on February 23    A 
specialist team sent to China found that the epidemic peaked and 
plateaued between January 23 and February 2, and has since been 
declining steadily, he said.   Dr Ghebreyesus said the death rate is
 between 2 per cent and 4 per cent in Wuhan city, where the virus 
originated, and 0.7 per cent outside Wuhan.   The mass outbreak has prompted the government to introduce a ban on direct flights from China to Australia.   Seven
 people have died and 229 have been infected in Italy, which is fighting
 Europe's first major coronavirus outbreak. Pictured: tourists wearing a

continue to advise Australians to not travel to China due to the novel 
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,' an update on the government's travel 
website says.   Offering advice to any Australians in the infection 
zone, the website states: 'If you are currently in China, leave as soon 
as possible by commercial means.'   Because flights to Australia are
 cancelled, anyone who wants to fly from China will have to travel to 
another country and wait there for 14 days before coming home.   Fourteen days is thought to be the maximum period that coronavirus can be present in a person before they show symptoms.

 need to start stocking up on food and supplies before the spread of the
 deadly coronavirus becomes a global pandemic and stocks of required 
goods start to run low, a survival expert has warned.   While the 
vast majority of the 80,000 infections have been within China, 37 people
 have died in South Korea, Italy and Iran as the new hot spots emerged 
in the past week for COVID-19.   One of Australia's leading 
survivalists said the nation's shoppers should start bulking up their 
weekly shop before the virus' spread leads to food supply 
shortages.     A Chinese couple in protective masks

said shoppers in Australia should start preparing their cupboards for a 
food shortage   'We should always be prepared for food 
shortages - not just from coronavirus but civil incidences, extreme 
weather and power outages which will cut us off from supply,' Western 
Australian survival instructor Bob Cooper told Daily Mail Australia on 
Wednesday.   Stockpiling by panicked shoppers has already seen 
shelves emptied in Italian towns at the centre of the country's outbreak
 in the northern Veneto and Lombardy regions.    Mr Cooper said
 it was too early for such panic here but said Australians should start 
thinking about whether their food cupboards can sustain them if the 
supply chain is broken.   'You need to think about things that have a
 long shelf life: dried fruit, dried foods, cereals, pasta will also 
last a long time,' he said.   'Packets of flour will also allow to make your own bread.'   The
 survival expert said shoppers should be prioritising vegetables rather 
than protein, as the former should make up 80 per cent of our diet.   Empty
 shelves are pictured in a supermarket near Milan in Italy's

said.    Mr Cooper said even more important than food is keeping a supply of your own drinking water in case the supply runs out.   'No-one
 is gonna die of starvation - it might get hard - but that should be the
 least of your priorities,' he said. 'You need to have your own water 
supply though.'    Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy 
(pictured) said the Australian government is preparing for the 
coronavirus spread to become a pandemic   University of 
Queensland virology expert Ian Mackay has also compiled a thorough list 
of items Australians should stockpile in a box labelled 'pandemic 
stash'.   As well as food items, included in the list are feminine 
hygiene products, over-the-counter medication, toilet paper and pet food
 if required.   The Australian government is preparing a contingency
 plan should the spread turn into a pandemic - a development which would
 be declared by the World Health Organisation.   'Every part of the 
health system is now working on its plan so that we're ready if things 
develop further in the future,' chief medical officer Brendan Murphy 
said.      It comes as Australia's federal sports minister warned the nation's athletes could be pulled out of the Tokyo  Olympics  in July as the  coronavirus  continues to spread globally.    'Australian
 athletes are ready to make their mark at the Tokyo Olympics - but it 
should not be at the risk of their health and well-being,' sports 
minister Richard Colbeck said.   'We continue to work with the 
relevant authorities both here and overseas to ensure our athletes 
remain safe and protected as the response to the coronavirus continues.'   Australian athletes can also choose on an individual basis whether to compete in Tokyo.   The
 virus has infected 80,000 - including 690 passengers on board the 
Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Pictured are passengers 
disembarking the ship on February 21 after a two-week quarantine ended   The
 government's chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said it was
 unclear how safe Japan would be for those travelling to the Games at 
this stage.    'We still haven't seen the full impact of the 
Diamond Princess outbreak - we're making a daily evaluation of the 
effects,' he said.    The worrying government comments follow 
Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates saying last week that
 organisers found no case for postponing or cancelling the Games.   In the past week, it emerged seven people had died and 229 are infected after an outbreak of the virus in Italy.    A
 third Victorian passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship has 
tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the state's total number of cases
 to seven, chief health officer Brett Sutton confirmed.   The trio were repatriated to Victoria and are recovering in isolation.   Four people who previously tested positive for the virus in Victoria have recovered, the state's health department said.

Three
 people from Queensland who were aboard the embattled cruise ship have 
also contracted the virus, as has one from South Australia and one from 
Western Australia.      The man, who officials said 
was already in isolation and is not sick, is the partner of a woman who 
was already diagnosed with the virus.    A potential ninth case is currently undergoing tests.     Eight
 Australians evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (pictured) 
last week are now confirmed to have coronavirus    The doomed ship was deemed an 'infection factory' after some health officials slammed the quarantine conditions on board.   Thousands
 of passengers were quarantined on board for two weeks after Japanese 
officials refused to let them disembark int he port of Yokohama.   A passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to have had the disease.    Despite
 a supposed quarantine imposed on the Diamond Princess, more than 600 
people on board tested positive for the virus, with several dozen in 
serious condition.   Australian evacuees (pictured) from the 
quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan arrive in Howard 
Springs, 30km southeast of Darwin, last week   Four passengers have since died.    Under
 Australia's evacuation plan, all evacuees from the ship who come down 
with the virus will be treated in their home states.    A total
 of 164 Australian citizens and permanent residents were evacuated from 
the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess and flown to Darwin on 
February 20.   They are being held in quarantine, seperately from the 266 people already at the facility in Howard Springs.   That larger group were evacuated earlier this month from the city of Wuhan, the disease's epicentre.     Medical staff dressed in protective clothing prepare to board the Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Japan (pictured)   Following
 news that a passenger who tested negative later developed the virus, 
Japanese health minister Katsunobu Kato has said that the government 
will have to keep close tabs on those who were allowed to leave the 
ship.   The country's health authorities will make daily phone calls
 to hundreds of people who have disembarked from the Diamond Princess, 
Kyodo News in Japan reports.   The minister added that the evacuees 
have already been asked to avoid using public transportation and told to
 wear masks when they come into contact with others.   'I can 
confirm that we have an eighth case from the Diamond Princess group that
 have been in quarantine. It is a Victorian man,' Federal Health 
Minister Greg Hunt said.   Health staff gather beside buses 
(pictured on February 20) to care for Australian evacuees after they 
arrived on a Qantas flight from Japan at Darwin International Airport   'His
 partner had previously been diagnosed, so he had already been in 
quarantine as part of the Diamond Princess and already in isolation, 
having travelled to Victoria with his partner.   'The director of 
the National Trauma Centre advised me that a further case is being 
investigated, but they are carrying out many tests on a routine basis 
and if that's either positive or negative will provide the answer was 
testing has been.'    It comes as the virus threatens to become uncontrollable, following a huge outbreak in South Korea and in Italy.   Japan has had 159 confirmed cases of the virus, many from those on the Diamond Princess which is still docked at Yokohama.   Hong Kong has suffered 81 confirmed cases and has shut its border with mainland China.   The Australian government says Aussies should take care when travelling to these areas by closely monitoring their health.   Despite recent outbreaks, Italy is still safe to travel to, according to DFAT.   Italy has 229 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including seven deaths.   Authorities
 have introduced measures to restrict the use of public spaces and limit
 travel in some parts of northern Italy where cases have occurred.   On Monday, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned the world must prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic.   Tedros
 Ghebreyesus said the spread of the virus around the world is not yet at
 pandemic stage but acknowledged it has the potential to become one.

 coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and 
people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to 
reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses 
are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they
 are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The 
coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this 
outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on
 Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed 
around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 
'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named 
after it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr
 Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a 
family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species 
including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild 
animals.    'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there 
were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of 
these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has 
been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and 
result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).    'Coronaviruses
 are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another 
and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new 
coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet 
known.'     The first human cases were publicly reported 
from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people 
live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on 
December 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had 
been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were 
developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The
 first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 
cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 
people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.      Where does the virus come from?    According
 to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from 
bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the 
similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet 
cats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came 
from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which 
has since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market 
is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being
 sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, 
porcupines and camel meat.    A study by the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific 
journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in 
patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found 
in bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so 
scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a 
middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a 
human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr
 Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not 
involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places 
the origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether
 another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, 
and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host 
might have been.'      So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?     Experts
 say the international community is concerned about the virus because so
 little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It
 is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 
in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus 
which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which
 killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for
 COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any 
immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This 
means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across 
often, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in 
January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel 
viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which
 circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most
 seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 
1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand
 fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate 
could be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.    'My
 feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this 
iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The
 illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, 
making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even
 before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the 
saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, 
kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live
 on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning 
people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,
 people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in 
Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been 
there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to 
person.     What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once
 someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 
days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still
 be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, 
typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever 
(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from 
these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an 
infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with 
fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing 
that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the
 virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to 
flu, but it is not clear why.       What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?         Scientists
 in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of 
the virus and released them to experts working around the world.    This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.      Examinations
 have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known 
as mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,
 the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it 
spread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and 
to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus 
might look different every time scientists analyse it.      More
 study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small 
number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were
 various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed 
separately.    How dangerous is the virus?      The
 virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death 
rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 
50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning
 of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are 
infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded 
cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they 
never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more 
serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it 
really is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr
 Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a 
mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only 
showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be 
accurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured?     The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics
 do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral
 drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then 
developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge 
amounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and 
it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this 
outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National 
Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, 
say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about 
coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But 
this may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,
 governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and
 to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People
 who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their 
symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected 
public.   And airports around the world are putting in place 
screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's 
temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot 
those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,
 it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small 
likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?       The
 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by 
the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new 
disease'.    Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside 
of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't 
actually spreading actively around the world.  "

'Businesses should start planning working from home arrangements,' Professor MacIntyre said.   The
 infectious diseases researcher also feared hospitals would be 
overwhelmed, forcing the postponement of elective surgery and an 
expansion of intensive care units.   She has released modelling 
showing tens of thousands of intensive care beds would be needed to 
cope, going by the Chinese infection rate.   Should 50 per cent of 
Australians be infected with coronavirus, in an extreme case 
scenario, 650,000 intensive care beds would be needed as 1.8million 
people required hospitalisation in one year.   Professor

 can achieve a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 with known 
technologies, but the deployment of low emissions options will need to 
be accelerated significantly, according to new analysis by ClimateWorks 
Australia.   The yet-to-be released analysis, which was previewed at a workshop at the Australian National University amid a  resumption of the climate wars in federal politics ,
 suggests transitioning to net zero will require Australiaas electricity
 market to be 100% renewables by 2035, as well as achieving deep energy 
efficiency and electrification in buildings, and an accelerated rollout 
of electric vehicles.   The analysis says to remain within 2C 
warming, Australia would need at least half of all new cars in 10 years 
time to be electric vehicles. On a trajectory of staying within 1.5C, it
 would be three in four cars. Current government projections point to 
one in five cars sold.   Staying within those pathways would also 
require renewables to make up more than 70% of energy generation by 
2030, rather than a 50% share.    Anna Skarbek ,
 the chief executive of ClimateWorks, which is a non-profit advisory 
body that works within the Monash Sustainable Development Institute, 
told an ANU forum reaching net zero in Australia was entirely possible. 
aWe know the technology is available, it is about how to accelerate the 
uptake,a she said.   aLooking just at the domestic economy, not the 
export economy, the technology mix is available for Australia to achieve
 net zero emissions within the carbon budget the science requires for 2C
 and for 1.5C.a   Skarbek a who is a former investment banker and a 
founding director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation a said 
achieving net zero would require dialling up progress on the known 
technologies and avastly scaling up carbon sequestration through 
forestry to buy us time to also scale up the research and development 
for the residual emissionsa.   aIf we want to achieve 1.5C instead 
of 2C warming, which we know from the science, 2C is exponentially worse
 than 1.5C, to do that, we canat afford any of these areas to be going 
slower than they could,a Skarbek said.   aItas all in.a   The 
work updates research the organisation did five years ago on pathways to
 decarbonisation, and Skarbek said the outlook had improved because of 
rapid improvements in technology. The new analysis updates modelling for
 Australia and it develops three Paris agreement-aligned scenarios.   The imminent release of the new analysis comes as  Laboras decision to sign on to a net zero target for 2050 
 a the oppositionas first major climate policy decision post-election a 
has prompted the Morrison government to blast Labor for proposing a 
long-term target in advance of a roadmap to get there.   While the 
Coalition has been attacking Labor, the government has not ruled out 
adopting its own 2050 target, and Scott Morrison this week  declined to criticise the New South Wales government  for adopting a net zero position for 2050.   Morrison
 told parliament he was happy to work with NSW on its ambition to hit 
net zero emissions by 2050 because the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, 
aha[d] a plana a although the specific plan the prime minister 
referenced on Tuesday ends in 2030.   The government will shortly 
release its own technology roadmap, work that forms part of its 
deliberations on driving the transition to low emissions. Morrison has 
said repeatedly he will not commit to any target beyond 2030 without 
understanding the costs, and the impact on jobs.    More than 70 countries and 398 cities 
 say they have adopted a net zero position. Every Australian state has 
also signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are 
expressed either as targets or aspirational goals. The Business Council 
of Australia, which represents Australiaas biggest companies, also 
argues Australia should  legislate a target of net zero emissions by 2050.     Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday 
 its globe-spanning operations will reach net zero emissions by 2050 and
 it will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon 
footprint.  "

 has blasted the school as a 'Chinese-driven money-making machine' after
 it offered students thousands of dollars in grants to help them get 
around the  coronavirus  ban.   The
 university said on Wednesday it would give students who have been 
affected by the virus and its 'associated travel restrictions' support 
packages of up to $7,500.   Eligible expenses include accommodation 
costs, fees from flight changes, costs associated with the 14-day 
quarantine period, and other financial losses.    It comes after the Australian government extended the ban on those coming from mainland  China  until February 29, affecting an estimated 65,000 Chinese students.    University
 Provost Professor Mark Considine said it has been a 'difficult time' 
for affected students and the financial support would help ensure they 
can complete their studies on time.    People wearing face masks walk by Flinders Street Station after cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in Melbourne   The
 University of Melbourne said on Wednesday it would give students who 
have been affected by the disease and its 'associated travel 
restrictions' support packages of up to $7,500   'The student 
support grants are intended to help students with unanticipated expenses
 incurred as a result of the travel restrictions related to COVID-19 and
 to help students transition to or return to study at the University of 
Melbourne', he said.    But the move has drawn criticism from a
 Melbourne student who said he was 'disappointed' to see the university 
shelling out cash to 'lure' Chinese students back into the country while
 Australian students are struggling to make ends meet.     'As
 an Australian citizen and student of the university I find it 
disgusting that the university is willing to offer such huge sums of 
money to those in China when I am struggling to catch public transport 
to university, pay for textbooks or even eat three meals per day,' the 
student told Daily Mail Australia.    'I feel as though the 
university is turning into a Chinese-driven money-making machine and I 
find this extremely disappointing and upsetting.   The 
University of Adelaide is offering a care package and remote study to

 infected become seriously ill while 5 per cent go into critical 
condition   'It feels like a form of bribery or incentive to 
lure Chinese students back into the country due to the current global 
situation.'   The deadly coronavirus outbreak has not only sparked 
fears of a national health crisis, but an economic one as 
well.      Centre for Independent Studies Professor Salvatore Babones told  The ABC  an estimated 18 per cent of the University of Melbourne's revenue comes from Chinese students.   'No other universities in the world are as exposed to Chinese tuition money,' he said.   'That's
 why we see the very dangerous moral hazard that universities are 
aggressively lobbying the Australian Government to relax its China 
travel ban.'    Australia's response to the virus with the 
travel ban on Chinese visitors and students is expected to have a major 
impact as Chinese students are reported to bring $40billion a year 
into the Australian economy.   'Our students and staff who remain in
 China are deeply stressed, and they are so keen to start or continue 
their studies,' Universities Australia chairwoman Deborah Terry told the
 National Press Club in Canberra.   'We will do all we can to ensure that your studies stay on track.'   
 Travellers are pictured wearing protective face masks at Brisbane

stay outside mainland China for two weeks.   Western Sydney 
University said it was willing to subside the cost of airfares and 
accommodation to allow them to reach Australia 'through a third 
country'.   'We consider the Australian Government's endorsement of 
entering Australia through a third country an important development, 
opening up the opportunity to arrive in time to commence study in 
Australia,' the e-mail said.   Days later, The University of Adelaide said it was offering a care package worth about $5,000 to about 3,000 Chinese students.   The
 package includes a 20 per cent discount on semester one tuition fees 
and up to $2000 towards airfares which they can access only once the 
travel ban is lifted.    It also offered online study help 
including videos of lectures, peer networking support and library 
resources so Chinese students who cannot be on campus by the March 26 
start date, so can keep up with their courses remotely.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8         Advertisement    "

 in male and female immune systems may have a direct link to men's 
propensity to develop obesity, heart disease, stroke and diabetes and 
women to suffer more from certain autoimmune diseases such as arthritis.   University
 of Melbourne lead researcher Ajithkumar Vasanthakumar said discovering 
differences between certain male and female cells was a ""remarkable 
breakthrough"" as scientists have previously been unable to understand 
the differences between male and female immune systems.   Researching
 male and female adipose tissue, or body fat, a team at the Doherty 
Institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute discovered striking 
differences in the numbers and function of an immune cell population 
called regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, between male and female mice.   Treg
 cells play a central role in the body by dampening inflammation, 
autoimmunity and maintaining the health of many tissues, including the 
body fat tissue, the researchers said.   Importantly, this tissue 
is not only stores energy, but also plays a crucial role in regulating 
metabolism, appetite and inflammation, as well as producing different 
hormones.   University of Melbourne Professor Axel Kallies, senior 
author and laboratory head at the Doherty Institute, said with the 
""unprecedented worldwide rise of obesity and metabolic disease"", the 
findings are important when considering new therapeutic approaches.   ""We
 are now exploring whether similar mechanisms are at play in autoimmune 
diseases and in cancers,"" Professor Kallies said on Thursday.   ""For
 too long the male physiology and the male immune system was considered 
the 'norm' in research and in clinical studies. Our work shows that 
important differences exists between the sexes.   ""This means that the strategies to treat a range of diseases may have to be different between men and women.""   The
 findings, from the team at the Doherty Institute and the Walter and 
Eliza Hall Institute at the University of Melbourne, are published in 
the journal Nature.   Researchers at Monash University and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre also collaborated.     Advertisement    "

 may hit Australia harder than China because of the country's ageing 
population, a leading bio-security expert has warned.   The flu-like
 virus, which spawned in Wuhan, China in December, is more severe in 
older people because their immune systems are weaker.   In Australia 16 per cent of the population are over 65, compared to just nine per cent in China, where some 2,700 have died.   On Thursday Prime Minister Scott Morrison extended Australia's travel ban on China for another week.    In
 a press conference, he said the coronavirus outbreak would soon enter a
 pandemic phase and the Australian government would initiate its 
emergency response plan.    He said: 'We believe that the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us.'    This map shows the number of cases of coronavirus as of 10am Sydney time on Thursday   The
 flu-like virus, which spawned in Wuhan, China in December, is more 
severe in older people because their immune systems are weaker (stock

 the University of New South Wales's Kirby Institute, warned Australia 
could be hit harder than China.   'The disease is clearly more severe the older you get,' she told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday.   'So we would see proportionately more severe disease because we have more older people than China does.'   Experts have raised fears that nursing homes will struggle to cope with a pandemic.   Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly told the  Daily Telegraph 
 that in a worst case scenario family visits would be banned, patients 
would be isolated and 'end of life planning' would be 
encouraged.     Professionals wearing protective gear prepare to disinfect against the coronavirus in South Korea   Civil protection and health workers deliver the evening meal at the Bel Sit hotel in Alassio, Italy   Last
 week the government lifted the ban on Year 11 and 12 students coming in
 from China under strict rules, and at the time said it would consider a
 controlled opening for Chinese university students a week later.   Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the government was constantly reviewing its position.   'We
 have been meeting multiple occasions every week so at the highest 
levels of the government we are constantly reviewing our response to 
coronavirus,' she told ABC Radio on Thursday.   'Australia has prepared ourselves well but this is obviously a significant growing issue.'   Coronavirus is rapidly spreading around Europe. This map shows the cases in each nation   A video shows how coronavirus has spread faster than SARS, MERS, Ebola and swine flu epidemics.   The
 clip - made by production company Abacaba, and uploaded to YouTube on 
February 12 - compares how quickly each disease spread once cases were 
reported.   At first, the coronavirus outbreak spread slower than Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and swine flu.   But,
 by Day 41 of their respective outbreaks, 243 were ill from Ebola, 182 
were sickened by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), 520 had come 
down with swine flu, and 3,600 were infected with SARS.   In 
comparison, on Day 41 of the coronavirus outbreak - February 12 - more 
than 41,700 people were infected worldwide.        Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton agreed the burgeoning spread of COVID-19, particularly in Italy, was concerning.   'We are now talking about 42 countries outside of China,' he told Sydney radio 2GB on Thursday.   'People should be reassured in Australia though, we have been able to contain in the way that we have.'      The
 disease has a low death rate of around 2 per cent, only slightly higher
 than flu, and the spread rate is already declining in China - 
but governments around the world were preparing for the worst.   On Wednesday experts said that Australian schools would be closed and mass public gatherings would be banned if the  coronavirus  escalated into a pandemic.   Instead of going to the workplace, Australians would be made to work from home.   Hospitals
 would also struggle to cope with an influx of patients - with modelling
 predicting a massive shortfall of 'coronavirus beds'.   In a 
worst-case scenario, Professor MacIntyre said that mass gatherings like 
sporting events and concerts would be banned and children would stay 
home from school.    Health experts were bracing for a scenario where up to 50 per cent of Australians get infected with the disease.   This map shows the travel warnings that are in place for Australians as of Wednesday   Schools

'Businesses should start planning working from home arrangements,' Professor MacIntyre said.   The
 infectious diseases researcher also feared hospitals would be 
overwhelmed, forcing the postponement of elective surgery and an 
expansion of intensive care units.   She has released modelling 
showing tens of thousands of intensive care beds would be needed to 
cope, going by the Chinese infection rate.   Should 50 per cent of 
Australians be infected with coronavirus, in an extreme case 
scenario, 650,000 intensive care beds would be needed as 1.8million 
people required hospitalisation in one year.   Professor

capacity, and fallback plans if needs cannot be met with existing beds 
and resources,' Professor MacIntyre said.   'If hospital beds run short, asking people with mild infection to stay home would be reasonable.   'We would likely see elective surgery delayed or rescheduled and reprioritisation of acute care.'   Coronavirus in China has a fatality rate of 2.3 per cent.    Health

 infectious diseases researcher also feared hospitals would be 
overwhelmed, forcing the postponement of elective surgery and an 
expansion of intensive care units.   She has released modelling 
showing tens of thousands of intensive care beds would be needed to 
cope, going by the Chinese infection rate.   Should 50 per cent of 
Australians be infected with coronavirus, in an extreme case 
scenario, 650,000 intensive care beds would be needed as 1.8million 
people required hospitalisation in one year.   Professor 
Raina MacIntyre, the head of biosecurity at the University of New South 
Wales Kirby Institute, said that in a worst-case scenario, mass 
gatherings like sporting events and concerts would be banned as children
 stayed home from school   Professor Raina MacIntyre, 
the head of biosecurity at the University of New South Wales Kirby 
Institute has also released modelling showing a massive shortfall in 
'coronavirus beds'   'The health system would need surge 
capacity, and fallback plans if needs cannot be met with existing beds 
and resources,' Professor MacIntyre said.   'If hospital beds run short, asking people with mild infection to stay home would be reasonable.   'We would likely see elective surgery delayed or rescheduled and reprioritisation of acute care.'   Coronavirus in China has a fatality rate of 2.3 per cent.    Health
 authorities in every Australian state are on high alert after the 
American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned coronavirus 
was worse than first feared.   'Current global circumstances suggest
 it's likely this virus will cause a pandemic,' the government 
agency's principal deputy director Dr Anne Schuchat told reporters 
on Tuesday night.   Should a pandemic occur, Australia's federal Department of Health warned hospitals were likely to be overrun.   'Demand
 on primary health care will also increase, exacerbated by the need to 
attend to patients affected by the changes in availability of services 
at hospitals,' it said last year in its Management Plan for Pandemic 
Influenza.   A coronavirus pandemic would also require measures to prevent diseases outbreaks in aged care homes and prisons.    Health
 Minister Greg Hunt has flagged the possible cancellation of sporting 
events, like AFL and rugby league games. Pictured are AFL Hawthorn Hawks
 supporters in Melbourne        Coronavirus,
 also known as COVID-19, has infected 80,000 worldwide since it 
originated in December at an animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.   This includes 23 people now in Australia, as of Wednesday.   Then
 there are another seven Australians who were flown from the Diamond 
Princess cruise ship at Yokohama in Japan to a quarantine centre near 
Darwin, where they tested positive.   Coronavirus has killed more 
than 2,600 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger 
multiple organ failure, particularly among the elderly or frail.   Australia is still in the containment stage of coronavirus.   Most contagion cases have occurred in China, with people also testing positive in South Korea, Japan and Italy.   Professor
 Sharon Lewin, the director of the University of Melbourne's Doherty 
Institute, said a pandemic occurred when 'there's sustained 
human-to-human transmission in multiple countries'.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      "

 that a doctor was told by parents of a child she was treating that they
 weren't comfortable with her treating their child due to the risk of 
coronavirus.   Dr Lewena spoke at a press conference on Thursday and
 said: 'It was clear that message was sent on the basis of her race. We

 told reporters that 'Paranoia around coronavirus is acceptable, but we 
need to be sensible and respectful in terms of how we go about dealing 
with it.'     Health Minister Jenny Mikakos also noted that the racial fears in regards to coronavirus were unnecessary.     'There
 is no place for this behaviour in our public hospitals, there is no 
place for this in our broader community,' she said in a statement on 
Thursday.    Melbourne's Children's Hospital launched an 
anti-racism warning on Thursday that criticized any abusive behaviour 
shown amid the coronavirus paranoia.   Doctors around Australia have spoken out about being racially abused by patients.    Gold
 Coast surgeon Dr Rhea Liang posted a tweet last month that said: 'Today
 a patient made jokes about not shaking my hand because of coronavirus. 
In front of my team.   'I have not left Australia. This is not sensible public health precautions. This is racism.'   The Department of Health spoke out against racial abuse fueled by the virus (file image)    Other
 doctors also reported being asked if coronavirus could be contracted 
from Chinese food or from sitting next to a person of Asian 
descent.      Chinese citizens have faced a racist backlash across the world following the outbreak of the deadly virus.   Restaurants
 in South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Vietnam have all refused to accept

long-term health before deciding to compete at the Tokyo Games.   As concerns mount over the spreading  coronavirus , the Australian swimming great says Olympic organisers must ensure athletes will be safe at the Games due to start on July 24.   'I would most definitely be concerned,' Thorpe told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.   Thorpe's
 comments come a day after senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
member Dick Pound warned the Tokyo Games could be cancelled due to the 
coronavirus.   Pound said any decision on whether the Olympics can proceed could be put off until late May.   'In
 and around that time, I'd say folks are going to have to ask: 'Is this 
under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo 
or not?'' Pound said.   People wearing protective face masks,

 five-time Olympic gold medallist Thorpe said the coronavirus risk was a
 factor athletes must consider before travelling to Tokyo.   'What 
we need to know is to use some of the best expert disease specialists to
 find out what is the risk to the team,' the retired swim star said.   'What
 is the risk to the other nations and how can we have an Olympic Games, 
one that is safe, that doesn't put athletes at risk?   'What you 
have to understand as well is there are other risks associated with an 
Olympic Games, the threat of a terrorist event taking place.   '... And we (athletes) take into consideration those things before we decide to compete.

warned the coronavirus may hit Australia harder than China because of 
the country's ageing population.     The flu-like virus, 
which spawned in Wuhan, China in December, is more severe in older 
people because their immune systems are weaker.

1463597856,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8051549/Top-doctor-sensationally-declares-Australia-contract-coronavirus.html,2020-02-27,Top doctor declares EVERYONE in Australia will contract coronavirus," Professor Ian Mackay works at the University of Queensland and specialises in virology   A top doctor has sensationally predicted everyone in Australia will fall victim to the  coronavirus .    Professor
 Ian Mackay, from the University of Queensland, said it is unlikely the 
deadly virus will ever be contained and the world should prepare for the
 worst.   The doctor's claim came as Prime Minister  Scott Morrison  told
 Australia a coronavirus pandemic was 'very much upon us' and detailed a
 plan to stockpile medicines, create makeshift clinics and place 
aged-care homes into lockdown.   Just hours after Mr Morrison's 
announcement, an Australian who was on board virus-hit cruise ship 
Diamond Princess was revealed to be in intensive care at a Perth 
hospital suffering the most severe case the country has seen so far.   The 78-year-old was one of 223 Australians quarantined on the ill-fated ship in Japan, and was flown to Darwin last Friday.   Eight
 Australians had been flown from the Diamond Princess cruise ship at 
Yokohama in Japan to a quarantine centre near Darwin (pictured), where 
they tested positive.   After tests showed the man had the 
deadly coronavirus, he was taken to his home state and is now in 
intensive care at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.      The
 elderly man was evacuated with his wife, who does not have the virus, 
and was said to be a in a 'serious but stable' condition.   Dr 
Mackay said it's unlikely the COVID-19 virus would 'go back in its 
box' and predicated all Australians would eventually be infected.   'We're likely to have the virus Abecome what we call an Aendemic virus, or a virus that's just with us for life,' he told  The Australian .   'We
 already have four of these coronaviruses, mostly causing colds. We get 
them every year. They peak during winter but they still move around 
Abetween us Aduring the rest of the year as well. So it's likely this 
might become one of those.      Minister for 
Health Greg Hunt, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Deputy Chief Medical
 Officer Professor Paul Kelly give an update on the coronavirus at a 
press conference   'At some point in the coming months or 
years we're all going to get infected because we've all been infected by
 these other endemic viruses.'    The government's emergency 
response plan, announced on Thursday, would allow federal and state 
governments to contain the virus if there was a widespread  
outbreak.   The World Health Organisation has not yet formally 
declared a global pandemic, but Mr Morrison said Australia was operating
 on the basis that there is one.    The prime minister on 
Thursday instructed Health Minister Greg Hunt to identify 'gaps in 
capabilities' within Australia's state-based health services as 
they combat the spread of the flu-like illness.   'We believe that the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.    'We need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.'    Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison has said the risk of a global coronavirus 
pandemic impacting Australia is likely, releasing the government's 
Australian Health Management Plan on Thursday.   The government is currently at the 'Initial action stage' which includes:   * Health Minister Greg Hunt assumes powers under Biosecurity Act.   * Enhanced border screening measures and communications with incoming travellers.   * Medical stockpiles deployed to states and territories ready for use.   * Potential outbreaks investigated.   * National response coordinated with states and territories.   The
 declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organisation or evidence 
of a large-scale, sustained transmission of the virus in Australia will 
move the government to a 'Targeted action stage', which would see:   * Department of Health coordinating response from National Incident Room.   * Health services surging staff numbers.   * Items from the National Medical Stockpile distributed to health services.   * Consideration of any border or social distancing measures.   * Response could be scaled up or down based on spread of virus.   If
 infection numbers reach a level that it can be contained by normal 
healthcare services, government moves to 'Standdown stage', which 
includes:   * Replenishing medical stockpiles.   * Resuming elective or non-urgent medical procedures.   * Monitoring for second wave of virus.   Mr
 Morrison said that during the past 24 hours, the 'rate of transmission 
of the virus outside of China is fundamentally changing the way we need 
to look at how this issue is being managed here in Australia'.   'As a result, we've agreed today and initiated the implementation of the coronavirus emergency response plan,' he said.   'Based
 on the expert medical advice we have received, there is every 
indication the world will enter a pandemic phase of the 
coronavirus.'    Mr Hunt warned parliament the 'arc of the 
virus' continues to expand with confirmed first cases reported in 
Algeria, Brazil, Greece and Pakistan.   'Against that background, the very clear message for Australians is that we are not immune but we are well prepared,' he said.   Pedestrian wearing face masks walk past a display promoting the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games on February 26   The government extended the ban on travellers entering Australia from China for another week.   The
 COVID-19 coronavirus has infected more than 82,000 people worldwide 
since it originated in December at an animal market in the Chinese city 
of Wuhan.   So far 23 people in Australia have fallen ill with the virus.    A
 78-year-old who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan is in 
intensive care at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital in Perth, the  West Australian  reported.   He is in a serious condition, however his wife who was evacuated alongside him does not have coronavirus.   Face-mask
 clad passengers on board The Spectrum of the Seas cruise liner arrived 
at Sydney Harbour on Thursday, just hours after Australia launched an 
emergency plan to tackle the  coronavirus  outbreak.   The
 Royal Caribbean ship pulled into port with about 30 people on board, 
many who wore protective masks as they disembarked.      As they stepped onto Australian soil, Prime Minister  Scott Morrison  told the nation a coronavirus pandemic was 'very much upon us'.    One male cruise ship employee wears a face mask as he gets off the Royal Caribbean ship in Sydney on Thursday   A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia no guests were on board the ship when it arrived on Thursday.    She
 said the passengers were crew members sent to Australia to cater for 
firefighters who will be taken on a free four-day cruise along the 
country's east coast starting on Saturday to thank them for their 
efforts tackling the summer's bushfires.    The spokeswoman said the ship has not been in China for more than two weeks, exceeding the public health guidelines.    People are seen taking in the sights of Sydney Harbour on Thursday after The Spectrum of the Seas arrived   Royal
 Caribbean earlier this month announced dates for two free cruises open 
to volunteers who helped battle the bushfire crisis.     The
 first four-night cruise will leave on Saturday, with the second on 
March 7. Both will travel north along Australia's coast before returning
 to Sydney.   Around 7,000 first responders and their families have booked for the complimentary voyage.   Two female cruise ship workers put on their face masks as coronavirus fears heighten across the globe   Earlier
 on Thursday, shelves of a Woolworths supermarket in the Sydney suburb 
of Bondi were stripped of medicine, toilet paper and food staples amid 
rising panic over coronavirus.    Customers were greeted with near empty aisles when they arrived at the supermarket on Thursday night.   The
 grocery store appeared to be struggling to keep the shelves stocked 
with paracetamol, toilet paper, tea, milk, pasta, oats and rice 
crackers.    The shelves of a Woolworths in the Sydney 
suburb of Bondi were stripped of medicine, toilet paper and food staples
 amid rising panic over coronavirus   Australians
 need to start stocking up on food and supplies before the spread of the
 deadly coronavirus becomes a global pandemic and stocks of required 
goods start to run low, a survival expert has warned.   While the 
vast majority of the 80,000 infections have been within China, 37 people
 have died in South Korea, Italy and Iran as the new hot spots emerged 
in the past week for COVID-19.   One of Australia's leading 
survivalists said the nation's shoppers should start bulking up their 
weekly shop before the virus' spread leads to food supply 
shortages.    'We should always be prepared for food shortages -
 not just from coronavirus but civil incidences, extreme weather and 
power outages which will cut us off from supply,' Western Australian 
survival instructor Bob Cooper told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.   Stockpiling
 by panicked shoppers has already seen shelves emptied in Italian towns 
at the centre of the country's outbreak in the northern Veneto and 
Lombardy regions.    Mr Cooper said it was too early for such 
panic here but said Australians should start thinking about whether 
their food cupboards can sustain them if the supply chain is broken.   'You
 need to think about things that have a long shelf life: dried fruit, 
dried foods, cereals, pasta will also last a long time,' he said.   'Packets of flour will also allow to make your own bread.'   The
 survival expert said shoppers should be prioritising vegetables rather 
than protein, as the former should make up 80 per cent of our diet.   'Things
 like root vegetables can be sun-dried and re-hydrated and last up to 
six months. I've tested it with bananas and fish as well,' he 
said.    Mr Cooper said even more important than food is keeping a supply of your own drinking water in case the supply runs out.   'No-one
 is gonna die of starvation - it might get hard - but that should be the
 least of your priorities,' he said. 'You need to have your own water 
supply though.'    Customers were greeted with near empty aisles when they arrived at the supermarket on Thursday night   Earlier
 this week, one woman from Queensland's Gold Coast revealed her family 
had started breeding fish to eat in case of economic collapse.   Coronavirus
 has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung 
damage and trigger multiple organ failure, particularly among the 
elderly or frail.    In Australia, 16 per cent of the 
population are over 65, compared to just nine per cent in China, where 
some 2,700 have died.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      "

 little bit of stock, maybe 12-24 in one day, they go,' Mr Garcia 
said.    'We obviously say to each person there is a maximum of two or three because we want everybody to be able to buy some.'   A Priceline spokesperson said any decision to limit customer purchases around hand sanitiser are made by individual stores.   The spokesperson said the rationing is not a directive among stores across the company.    The

The 78-year-old was one of 223 Australians quarantined on the ill-fated ship in  Japan , and was flown to Darwin last Friday.   After
 tests showed the man had the deadly coronavirus, he was taken to his 
home state and is now in intensive care at the Sir Charles Gairdner 
Hospital.      The elderly man was evacuated with his
 wife, who does not have the virus, and was said to be a in a 'serious 
but stable' condition.   He is one of 23 people in Australia battling the virus, but there have been no deaths.   The
 ill-fated Diamond Princess cruise ship (pictured) was put into 
isolation in Japan, after passengers contracted the deadly coronavirus   Worldwide, the virus has wiped out more than 2,800 people and infected 82,000.    A
 spokeswoman for the hospital said the move into the intensive care unit
 was 'precautionary', and confirmed he had been in isolation at the 
hospital.   The hospital has four negative pressure rooms to treat coronavirus patients.   So far, two Japanese passengers who caught the virus on board the Diamond Princess have died.   Both were in their 80s, and suffered underlying health conditions.     At
 least 621 people on the ship tested positive for the virus, officially 
named Covid-19, making it the biggest cluster outside China.   It comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a coronavirus pandemic is 'very much upon us'.   Launching an emergency plan on Thursday afternoon, he said the government were identifying  'gaps in capabilities' within Australia's state-based health services.    Evacuees

'We need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.'   Speaking again on 2GB on Friday morning, he insisted that the public should 'go about our business'.    He confirmed there are still 23 cases in Australia, eight of whom were on the Diamond Princess.   'One of these is in a more serious condition in WA, we learnt today,' he said.    'But in the rest of the community we can go about our business.'   Crew members are seen aboard the doomed cruise ship, which has been docked in the Japanese port of Yokohama for weeks        Mr
 Morrison said that during the past 24 hours, the 'rate of transmission 
of the virus outside of China is fundamentally changing the way we need 
to look at how this issue is being managed here in Australia'.   'As a result, we've agreed today and initiated the implementation of the coronavirus emergency response plan,' he said.   'Based
 on the expert medical advice we have received, there is every 
indication the world will enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus.'   At

guidelines said.   'They should, however, go quickly through any

 week the government lifted the travel ban, allowing Chinese students 
undertaking year 11 and 12 in Australia to enter the country in order to
 pass their courses.   But the relaxation of the rules still bans 
students from Hubei province in China, the epicentre of the 
outbreak, from entering Australia.    Around 760 Chinese 
students could be allowed into Australia if they are tested for 
coronavirus before leaving China and again when touching down 
here.     After this, they will be quarantined at home for 14 days before being allowed to go to school.     There
 are 389 Chinese students set to undergo year 11 and 12 courses in 
Victoria, and around 153 in New South Wales, with more scattered around 
other parts of Australia.    But under the Victorian 
Government's quarantine guidelines, host families aren't required to 
wear masks and don't have to isolate themselves from the public.  
     'Other members of the household are not required to 
be isolated unless they have also travelled to mainland China in the 
past 14 days, or have been in close contact with a confirmed case of 
COVID-19. Other members of the household do not need to wear a mask at 
any time,' Victoria's Department of Health states.   According to Federal Department of Health guidelines, quarantined students are only required to wear a mask if symptoms develop.   They're also advised to use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household.     So far 23 people in Australia have been diagnosed with coronavirus and all have been cleared.     Hundreds

 is already buckling under the weight of the coronavirus epidemic - with
 the stock market in free fall, supermarket shelves bare and a panic 
sale on flights.    With the world on the cusp of an 
unstoppable pandemic, experts warned every Australian could soon be 
struck down by the killer virus.   Families could soon see their supermarket bill balloon as worried households begin to stockpile food and medicines.    The
 Australian Securities Exchange has now fallen for the sixth straight 
session, shedding $221 billion - or 10 per cent - in just one week, 
including $72 billion on Friday morning alone.   It comes as the 
respiratory virus infected more than 82,000 people worldwide - including
 23 in Australia - causing 2,804 deaths.    The deadly strain, known now as Covid-19, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.    Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   The economic plunge threatened to get even worse after  Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a coronavirus pandemic is 'very much upon us'.    Launching
 an emergency plan on Thursday afternoon, he said the government was 
identifying 'gaps in capabilities' within Australia's state-based health
 services.    As residents prepare for the epidemic to hit, 
with 23 people already struck down on Australian soil, there is already 
evidence of panicked stockpiling.   Shocking photos emerged showing Woolworths shelves stripped of medicine, toilet paper and food staples.   Customers
 were greeted with near empty aisles when they arrived at the 
supermarket giant's Bondi store in Sydney on Thursday night.   The 
grocery store appeared to be struggling to keep the shelves stocked with
 paracetamol, toilet paper, tea, milk, pasta, oats and rice 
crackers.    In just one week, the ASX 200 went from a record closing high of 7,162 last Thursday to 6,441 by 10am on Friday (stock image)   Speaking
 to reporters in Canberra on Thursday afternoon, Mr Morrison confirmed 
Australia would operate as if coronavirus was already a pandemic.    'There is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus,' he said.   'And as a result, we have agreed today and initiated the implementation of the Coronavirus Emergency Response Plan.   'We
 believe that the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us and as a
 result, as a government, we need to take the steps necessary to prepare
 for such a pandemic.   'There is no need for us to be moving towards not having mass gatherings of people.    'You
 can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can 
still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to 
the concert, and you can go out for a Chinese meal.   'You can do 
all of these things because Australia has acted quickly, Australia has 
got ahead of this at this point in time.    'But to stay ahead of it, we need to now elevate our response to this next phase.'   Coronavirus fears wiped an incredible $72 billion off the Australian stock exchange on Friday morning.   It tumbled from a record closing high of 7,162 last Thursday to just 6,441 at 10am on Friday.   The dollar has fallen below 66 US cents for the first time in a decade.    Indicating
 that businesses are struggling, Air New Zealand slashed prices to 
Australia to just $69 on Friday morning in a bid to boost sales.   The
 airline is offering $69 one way flights from Christchurch to Melbourne,
 while fares for Auckland to Sydney and Brisbane will set Kiwis back 
$79.   It'll cost passengers just $69 to fly from Christchurch to Melbourne one way, and $79 to fly into Brisbane.   The cheap airfares are available for travel from mid-March.    Thanks
 to coronavirus travel bans, Air New Zealand, Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin
 Australia have reduced the amount of flights heading across the 
ditch.    But they are lowering ticket prices to fill up the remaining planes.   There are currently 23 cases of coronavirus in Australia, eight of which originated on the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship.   At
 least 621 people on the ship tested positive for the virus, officially 
named Covid-19, making it the biggest cluster outside China.   There were a total of 223 Australians quarantined on the ill-fated ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.    Eight
 Australians had been flown from the Diamond Princess cruise ship at 
Yokohama in Japan to a quarantine centre near Darwin (pictured), where 
they tested positive   Fears are growing for one 78-year-old 
man from Western Australia, who has been rushed into intensive care at 
the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.   Worldwide, the virus has killed more than 2,800 people and infected 82,000.    'We believe that the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us,' he told reporters in Canberra.   'We need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.'   An
 expert has issued a stark warning about the future of the virus, saying
 it is unlikely it will ever be contained and the world should prepare 
for the worst.   Pedestrian wearing face masks walk past a display promoting the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games on February 26   Minister

what we call an Aendemic virus, or a virus that's just with us for 
life,' he told The Australian.    'At some point in the coming 
months or years we're all going to get infected because we've all been 
infected by these other endemic viruses.'    The World Health 
Organisation has not yet formally declared a global pandemic, but Mr

 Italian government declared a state of emergency over coronavirus   Another wrote: 'Yes, we cancelled. Why risk your kids lives/health? I won't be heading overseas until this situation plays out.'   Bali
 Airport said there were 40,000 hotel booking cancellations in recent 
weeks and in the first half of February visitors were down 16.25 per 
cent on last year.    'Bali is very very quiet, haven't seen Bali like this ever,' one traveller who was on the island last week wrote.   Travel
 agencies are struggling too with Flight Centre admitting to investors 
its yearly earnings would be battered by $100 million.   Chief 
executive Graham Turner said airlines were locked in an 'extraordinary 
price war' as they scrambled to sell their vacant seats.   'One 
thing for sure is once we know a bit more about the virus we will be 
aggressive in marketing what are perceived as safe destinations, such as
 New Zealand, South Pacific and the U.S.,' he told investors on 
Wednesday.   But not even flights closer to home in comparatively 
'safe' New Zealand are exempt with Qantas dropping some trans-Tasman 
fares to $119.   Air New Zealand went even further with flights in 
March costing just $69 on the Auckland-Melbourne leg and just $10 more 
for many others.   Flights across the ditch usually cost at least 
$240 when booked about a month in advance, as is the case with these 
flights.    The
 coronavirus outbreak means Australia will have 1.8 million fewer 
international visitors in the first six months of this year compared to 
last year, a group representing tourism and transport companies says.   The
 Tourism and Transport Forum estimates the number of foreign travellers 
visiting the country between January and June 2020 will be down 40 per 
cent on the same period in 2019.   TTF chief executive Margy Osmond 
said the peak industry body for the tourism, transport and aviation 
sectors had produced economic modelling to show the effects of COVID-19 
if the virus was not able to be contained within the next three to six 
months.   The TTF suggested there would be an average monthly loss in total tourism receipts of $2 billion beyond March.   'What
 we are facing is a contracted visitor economy with significant losses 
across international visitation, tourism spend and employment in 2020 
and beyond,' he said.   'The economic impacts reflect the loss of 
direct tourism spend (tourism receipts) by the reduction in 
international visitor arrivals and the estimated reduction in employment
 within the visitor economy due to business slowing, [or] in some 
instances closure.'   These losses would be worse than the 2003 SARS
 epidemic that slashed international visitors to Australia by 9.4 per 
cent and cost $US30-50 billion.   Australia is even more reliant on 
Chinese tourism than in 2003 and that source has been reduced to zero by
 the government's travel ban.   Australians are so fearful of travelling at all that Qantas and Jetstar are cutting capacity on domestic routes by 2.3 per cent.   Jetstar in response offered fared as low as $29 on major routes in a desperate attempt to limit the damage.    One
 of the best deals is flights from the east coast of Australia to Los 
Angeles on Qantas at an unheard-of $564 return with similar prices for 
San Francisco.   Toronto and Vancouver can be visited for little 
over $900 on some airlines and Fiji Airways is running routes to 
its home nation for $526.   Asia, where the virus has far more 
cases, has been belted even harder with Qantas forced to cut 16 per cent
 of its capacity there and Jetstar 14 per cent.   Some routes had the number of flights cut by half and those that are running are often using smaller planes.    Virgin has canned its Hong Kong route altogether from Melbourne and will stop flying there from Sydney next week.   Outrageous deals are on sale as a result with flights that would usually go for hundreds down to double digits.   Air
 Asia launched a blitz sale to Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and India
 with flights to its base in Kuala Lumpur going for just $89, and 
Brisbane to Bangkok for $103.    Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   Travellers
 said they feared not only catching coronavirus abroad, but being stuck 
overseas by travel bans and cancellations, or being forced into 
quarantine.    Lisa Van Der Westhuizen, from Sydney, cancelled 
her holiday with a friend to Japan after the government raised the alert
 level.    'I just thought it seemed a little bit riskya| and 
I've got young kids (and) one of them, in particular, gets asthma when 
he is sick,' she told SBS.   'In my mind, I was thinking there would
 be a chance it would escalate while I was over there and be impacted by
 a quarantine period on the way home.'   Australians who have 
already booked flights or are thinking of doing so should check with 
airlines and travel insurance companies to see their policies.   Many
 insurers are not covering coronavirus claims at all unless the flights 
were booked many months ago before the virus became a 'known event' on 
January 23.   Airlines and insurers also won't pay you back if you 
just decide it's too risky to travel somewhere, or at all, but if a 
country is added to the 'do not travel' list they may relent.   Policies marked 'cancel for any reason' exist but they are more expensive than usual ones.   Travellers
 also need to be careful if they have a layover in Singapore, Hong Kong,
 or Malaysia as authorities will give everyone temperature checks and 
anyone with symptoms will be sent to hospital for quarantine.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      "

The signs have cautioned the community to be wary of which public spaces they enter amid the deadly coronavirus epidemic.   Coronavirus has infected 23 people in Australia, eight of whom caught the virus aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in  Japan .   Warnings
 for coronavirus have started popping up outside medical centres, train 
stations and office buildings in Sydney. Pictured: A sign outside 
Downing Centre Local and District Court in Sydney's CBD   Coronavirus has infected 23 people in Australia, eight of whom caught the virus aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan   Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   Sydney's
 Downing Centre Local and District Court placed a warning letter outside
 its building in the CBD on Thursday morning.     'Department
 of Communities and Justice has a duty of care to ensure the safety and 
wellbeing of persons in the workplace,' the sign read.     'Do
 not enter premises if you or someone you have been in close contact 
with has returned from travel from mainland China, including Hubei 
Province in the last 14 days.   'Please be alert to any changes in 
your health if you have travelled from Asia, in particular China, Japan,
 Thailand and South Korea.'     The notice went on to 
describe the symptoms of the deadly virus, and urged the public to seek 
medical attention if they suffer from any signs of the 
illness.     It comes a day after Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a coronavirus pandemic is 'very much upon us'.   Mr
 Morrison instructed Health Minister Greg Hunt to identify 'gaps in 
capabilities' within Australia's state-based health services to combat 
the spread of the deadly illness from China.   'We believe that the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison has said the risk of a global coronavirus 
pandemic impacting Australia is likely, releasing the government's 
Australian Health Management Plan on Thursday.   The government is currently at the 'Initial action stage' which includes:   * Health Minister Greg Hunt assumes powers under Biosecurity Act.   * Enhanced border screening measures and communications with incoming travellers.   * Medical stockpiles deployed to states and territories ready for use.   * Potential outbreaks investigated.   * National response coordinated with states and territories.   The
 declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organisation or evidence 
of a large-scale, sustained transmission of the virus in Australia will 
move the government to a 'Targeted action stage', which would see:   * Department of Health coordinating response from National Incident Room.   * Health services surging staff numbers.   * Items from the National Medical Stockpile distributed to health services.   * Consideration of any border or social distancing measures.   * Response could be scaled up or down based on spread of virus.   If
 infection numbers reach a level that it can be contained by normal 
healthcare services, government moves to 'Standdown stage', which 
includes:   * Replenishing medical stockpiles.   * Resuming elective or non-urgent medical procedures.   * Monitoring for second wave of virus.   'We need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.'    Australian
 Border Force is drawing up plans for extra measures at airports and 
shipping ports to ensure travellers suspected of having the virus can be
 quarantined or self-quarantined quickly.   'As this spreads we are 
going to have to monitor the hotspots around the world for coronavirus 
and overlay that with travel patterns,' ABF commisioner Michael Outram 
told Sky News.   'It's hard to travel directly to Australia so that gives us some choke points that we can focus on.'    It
 comes a day after Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a coronavirus 
pandemic is 'very much upon us'. Pictured with Minister for Health 
Greg Hunt (left) and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly 
(right)   Professor Ian Mackay, from the University of 
Queensland, issued a stark warning about the future of the virus, 
saying it is unlikely it will ever be contained and the world should 
prepare for the worst.   'We're likely to have the virus Abecome 
what we call an Aendemic virus, or a virus that's just with us for 
life,' he told The Australian.   'At some point in the coming months
 or years we're all going to get infected because we've all been 
infected by these other endemic viruses.'   The World Health 
Organisation has not yet formally declared a global pandemic, but Mr 
Morrison said Australia was operating on the basis that there is one.

 Wednesday, the Osaka prefectural government in Japan said a woman 
working as a tour-bus guide had tested positive for the coronavirus for a
 second time. This followed reports in China that discharged patients 
throughout the country were testing positive after their release from 
the hospital.    An official at Chinaas National Health Commission said on Friday that such patients have not been found to be infectious.     Experts
 say there are several ways discharged patients could fall ill with the 
virus again. Convalescing patients might not build up enough antibodies 
to develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and are being infected again. The 
virus also could be abiphasica, meaning it lies dormant before creating 
new symptoms.       But some of the first cases of areinfectiona in China have been attributed to testing discrepancies.    On
 Feb. 21, a discharged patient in the southwestern Chinese city of 
Chengdu was readmitted 10 days after being discharged when a follow-up 
test came back positive.     Lei Xuezhong, the deputy director of 
the infectious diseases centre at the West China Hospital, told Peopleas
 Daily that hospitals were testing nose and throat samples when deciding
 whether patients should be discharged, but new tests were finding the 
virus in the lower respiratory tract.    Paul Hunter, a professor of
 medicine at Britainas University of East Anglia who has been closely 
following the outbreak, told Reuters that although the patient in Osaka 
could have relapsed, it is also possible that the virus was still being 
released into her system from the initial infection, and she wasnat 
tested properly before she was discharged.    The woman first tested
 positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital on Feb. 
1, leading some experts to speculate that it was biphasic, like anthrax.
     A Journal of the American Medical Association study of four 
infected medical personnel treated in Wuhan, the epicentre of the 
epidemic, said it was likely that some recovered patients would remain 
carriers even after meeting discharge criteria.    In China, for 
instance, patients must test negative, show no symptoms and have no 
abnormalities on X-rays before they are discharged.    Allen Cheng, 
professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University in 
Melbourne, said it wasnat clear whether the patients were re-infected or
 had remained apersistently positivea after their symptoms disappeared. 
But he said the details of the Japan case suggested the patient had been
 reinfected.    Song Tie, vice director of the local disease control
 centre in southern Chinaas Guangdong province, told a media briefing on
 Wednesday that as many as 14% of discharged patients in the province 
have tested positive again and had returned to hospitals for 
observation.     He said one good sign is that none of those patients appear to have infected anyone else.    aFrom
 this understanding ... after someone has been infected by this kind of 
virus, he will produce antibodies, and after these antibodies are 
produced, he wonat be contagious,a he said.    Normally, 
convalescing patients will develop specific antibodies that render them 
immune to the virus that infected them, but reinfection is not 
impossible, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a specialist in infectious diseases
 at the University of Sydney.    aIn most cases though, because 
their body has developed an immune response to the first infection, the 
second infection is usually less severe,a Kamradt-Scott said.    Other
 experts have also raised the possibility of aantibody-dependent 
enhancementa, which means exposure to viruses might make patients more 
at risk of further infections and worse symptoms.       China has so
 far discharged 36,117 patients, according to data from the National 
Health Commission released on Friday, which represents almost 46% of the
 total cases on the Chinese mainland. If the 14% rate of reinfection is 
accurate and remains consistent, it could pose a wider health risk.    aI would say that it is less about if it is possible that re-infection can occur than how often it occurs,a Cheng said.     Reporting

1464412083,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14858-0,2020-02-28,Open access resource for cellular-resolution analyses of corticocortical connectivity in the marmoset monkey," Understanding
 the principles of neuronal connectivity requires tools for efficient 
quantification and visualization of large datasets. The primate cortex 
is particularly challenging due to its complex mosaic of areas, which in
 many cases lack clear boundaries. Here, we introduce a resource that 
allows exploration of results of 143 retrograde tracer injections in the
 marmoset neocortex. Data obtained in different animals are registered 
to a common stereotaxic space using an algorithm guided by expert 
delineation of histological borders, allowing accurate assignment of 
connections to areas despite interindividual variability. The resource 
incorporates tools for analyses relative to cytoarchitectural areas, 
including statistical properties such as the fraction of labeled neurons
 and the percentage of supragranular neurons. It also provides purely 
spatial (parcellation-free) data, based on the stereotaxic coordinates 
of 2 million labeled neurons. This resource helps bridge the gap between
 high-density cellular connectivity studies in rodents and imaging-based
 analyses of human brains.   We introduce a resource comprising curated results of retrograde tracer injections performed in the cortex of marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ), made accessible through a web site ( http://marmosetbrain.org ).
 This resource builds upon earlier demonstrations of the feasibility of 
registration of retrograde tracer data in primates to a common template,
 and of sharing such data through online platforms  1 , 2  ,
 but represents a distinct step towards cellular-level connectomic 
analyses of the primate brain. The present release incorporates 
methodological refinements which improve the accuracy of the attribution
 of neurons to areas, as well as new datasets including the stereotaxic 
coordinates of neurons revealed by the experiments, estimates of the 
white matter distances involved in each connection, and volumetric 
representations that enable integration with neuroimaging platforms. 
This functionality is made available through a dedicated analysis 
interface which enables quantification and visualization of results in 
individual cases, or aggregated by cortical area.   The 
contributions of neurons to perception, action, or cognition are 
fundamentally determined by the connections they form with other 
neurons. Complete maps of neuronal connections have been achieved for 
simple nervous systems  3  ,
 but uncovering the organizational principles that govern neuronal 
connectivity in mammals is most realistically tackled at the mesoscopic 
level  4  , by taking advantage of regularities in the patterns of connections formed by clusters of adjacent neurons  5  .
 Although this is still a vast challenge, progress in informatics has 
dramatically increased our capabilities to generate, store, and analyze 
large datasets, which in turn enhance our understanding of brain 
function through detailed computational models and analyses.   Presently,
 there are several projects aimed at exploring connections throughout 
the mouse brain using grids of anterograde and retrograde tracer 
injections, which yield single cell resolution and information about the
 direction of information flow  6 , 7  .
 In parallel, the use of magnetic resonance imaging has allowed studies 
of the principal axonal tracts in the human brain, but at a much lower 
resolution  8  .
 Integrating these two streams of investigation has been difficult, 
given not only the different technologies used, but also neuroanatomical
 differences, particularly with respect to the cerebral cortex. Several 
subdivisions of the primate frontal and posterior parietal cortex, which
 are involved in higher-order cognition and sensorimotor integration, do
 not exist as separate areas in rodents  9 , 10 , 11  .
 Likewise, the primate occipital and temporal lobes comprise a large 
number of visual and auditory association areas which have no clear 
rodent counterparts  12 , 13  .
 Thus, cellular-resolution datasets of connections in non-human primates
 are necessary to bridge the gap between the gold standard tracer-based 
datasets obtained in rodent brains and our evolving knowledge of the 
human brain.   The most extensive resources on cortical connections in non-human primates currently available are CoCoMac  14  
 (an online platform based on meta-analysis of the literature) and 
CoreNets (a collection of tracer injections in 29 areas, obtained with 
consistent methodology)  15 , 16  .
 Both of these give access to information on the macaque monkey cortex, 
but are limited in terms of access to full datasets and integrated 
functionality for analysis. A recently available dataset offers 
high-resolution images of tracing experiments in marmosets, but no 
facility for quantification  2  .
 Here we introduce a resource which significantly extends present 
capabilities, by giving open access to complete, curated datasets 
obtained in marmosets, integrated with visualization and quantification 
tools. Marmosets are small (~350ag) New World primates which have become
 increasingly important for studies of cognitive function and 
dysfunction, in part due to the relatively short developmental cycle, 
which facilitates the development of transgenic lines  17   and studies across the life span  18  .   The
 cerebral cortex is conceptualized to consist of areas characterized by 
distinct cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture, as well as different 
distributions of immunocytochemical markers and patterns of gene 
expression. Neurons in different areas are traditionally regarded as 
distinct in terms of connections and functions. In principle, the 
clustering of neurons into areas simplifies the problem of detecting 
regularities in cortico-cortical patterns of connections, and thus the 
information flow; indeed, each of the neuroinformatics resources 
currently available for connections in the mammalian brain is anchored 
on the notion of areas. However, the reality is far more complex. 
Functionally defined areas can be both histologically and connectionally
 heterogeneous  19 , 20 , 21  , and single cytoarchitectural areas often prove, upon closer examination, to include connectionally distinct subregions  22 , 23  . Further, the histological limits of cortical areas are often very subtle  24  : for example, current estimates of the number of areas in the macaque cortex vary between 91  15   and &gt;150  25 , 26  .
 These factors hinder integration of data raised by different groups, 
and constitute obstacles for scientific progress in general: the 
different sets of nomenclatures and criteria, together with the fact 
that the primary datasets are not made publicly available, typically 
make it impossible to analyze results retrospectively.   These 
challenges define the theoretical, analytical, and computational 
requirements for a resource aimed at facilitating research on the 
connectional architecture of the cortex. Primarily, such a resource 
should provide access to data in the form of directional connections 
within a common stereotaxic space, using a consistent nomenclature to 
describe the results both spatially and semantically (thus enabling 
analyses based purely on spatial distribution of connected cells, as 
well as those according to areas). The underlying data should be 
provided in full, and the resource should offer support for large-scale 
models and simulations by enabling access to data in a programmatic and a
 machine-mineable way  27 , 28  . The Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas ( http://marmosetbrain.org )
 addresses these goals. To enable graph-based network analyses, this 
resource includes tools for the quantification of connections between 
currently recognized areas  29  .
 In addition, it comprises the stereotaxic coordinates of labeled 
neurons, thus opening new avenues of exploration that are purely 
spatially based, enabling direct comparisons with results of 
non-invasive imaging methods, and allowing for future analyses that 
incorporate new schemes of parcellation. We showcase the capabilities of
 this resource by performing convergent area, injection, and single-cell
 based tests of hypotheses derived from human neuroimaging experiments, 
which postulate relationships between neuronal connectivity, distance 
from primary sensory and motor areas, and affiliation to different 
resting state networks  30 , 31  .   The Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas is accessible through the  http://marmosetbrain.org 
 portal. This resource provides online access to the primary 
experimental data, as well as the database of connectivity patterns 
quantified according to the parcellation of the marmoset cortex  29   (see Supplementary Table  1  for a list of areas and their abbreviations, and Supplementary Table  2 
 for a list of tracers used). The present release includes the results 
of injections centered in 55 of the 116 currently recognized areas of 
the marmoset cortex, encompassing subdivisions of prefrontal, premotor, 
superior temporal, parietal, and occipital complexes (Fig.  1 ). A list of all injections is available in Supplementary Table  3 , while comparisons between data obtained with different tracers are provided in Supplementary Figs.  1  and  2 .
 Across all injections, 1,968,388 tracer-labeled cells were mapped. The 
data were registered to a volumetric brain template through a pipeline 
that assures anatomical accuracy by taking into account 
cytoarchitectural, myeloarchitectural, and chemoarchitectural 
information to guide the registration process (see the aMethodsa 
section, 3D reconstruction and mapping procedure). This, and expert 
curation of the results, provides a high degree of spatial precision, 
largely circumventing the effects of individual variability.    a 
 The injections are illustrated in a two-dimensional (flat) map of the 
marmoset cortex, with the number of injections in each area indicated. 
For abbreviations of the areas, see Supplementary Table  1 . Medial  b  and lateral  c

the injections indicated (the dashed outline indicates the pial 
surface). In these views, the tracers used in each injection are coded 
by color (blue: FB, yellow: DY, dark green: FE, red: FR, teal: CTBgr, 
pink: CTBr), and the diameters of the spheres are proportional to the 
volumes of the injection sites. Scale bar: 5amm.   Figures  2 a 4  illustrate the main features of the portal. The connectional data are accessible via the Injections page (Fig.  2 a),
 where the locations of tracer injections are displayed in a 
computationally generated unfolded map of the marmoset cortical areas 
(Fig.  1 a).
 A searchable index allows the user to select injections based on single
 or combined criteria, including area, type of tracer used, case 
designation, or metadata keywords. Access to the data obtained following
 an individual injection can also be achieved by pointing and holding 
the mouse over a location on the map; this takes the user to a summary 
of the data, and gives access to navigating the full dataset for that 
injection.    a  Gateway page of the portal ( http://marmosetbrain.org )
 offering access to different components of the website, including the 
primary experimental data (Injections tab) and quantitative results, 
such as the FLNe, SLN, and interareal distance matrices (Connectivity 
Matrix tab, see Fig.  3 ). The Reference Materials tab gives access to the reference atlas  29  ,
 the volumetric template of the marmoset brain, and histology protocols.
 The Project Document tab provides background information on the aims of
 the project and its implementation.  b  Highlight of the main 
features of the high-resolution section viewer (injection CJ180-DY used 
as an example). An image of a Nissl-stained section (r20) is 
overlaid with the injection site and halo (yellow polygons, drawn under 
the microscope), as well as locations of cells labeled by DY and other 
tracers injected in this case (points in various colors). The navigation
 bar (bottom) offers a quick way of traversing across the dataset while 
the widgets (buttons on the top left) allow for adjusting the view 
according to one's requirements. The cortical areas on the section are 
annotated based on the registration to the reference atlas  29   (thumbnail in the top right corner). The contents of the portal are available under an open license ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ ).   Selecting
 an injection opens a section viewer, which displays the results of all 
injections placed in a given cerebral hemisphere (Fig.  2 b).
 The viewer allows visualization of the locations of the neurons labeled
 by different tracers, the core and halo regions of each injection, and 
high-resolution images of the underlying histology, which can be viewed 
at different magnifications. The identity of each cortical area, 
according to registration to the atlas parcellation  29  ,
 can be determined by hovering the cursor over the images, and results 
from individual tracers can be shown or hidden as required by using the 
switches on the top left of the navigator window. Rapid access to 
sections representing any anteroposterior level can be achieved by a 
slide-and-click navigator at the bottom of the page. Each injection is 
accompanied by metadata about the sex, age, and experimental history of 
each animal (accessible through the Case metadata button), and summaries
 of the projection patterns can be obtained in the form of 
two-dimensional maps of the cortex (Flat Map button).   An important
 component of the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas is the interface for
 exploring the quantitative results of the tracer injections, which can 
be accessed via the Connectivity Matrix tab. This part of the portal 
provides access to data on the strength and direction of connection 
between areas (fraction of labeled neurons, extrinsic; FLNe: Fig.  3 a) and the laminar origin of the projections (fraction of supragranular layer neurons; SLN: Fig.  3 b). In addition, estimates of distances between cortical areas (Supplementary Fig.  3 ) can be obtained through the Quick links menu (Fig.  4 a). Each column in the matrices (Fig.  3 )
 represents the connections of an area which received at least one 
tracer injection, which can be arranged according to alphabetical order,
 rostrocaudal coordinates, or hierarchical clustering (whereby areas 
characterized by similar connectivity patterns appear adjacent to each 
other). Alternatively, the connectivity data can be viewed as a graph 
(Graph view) which highlights spatial relations (Fig.  4a ).
 Hovering the cursor over the intersection of two areas in the matrices,
 or pointing at a graph edge, provides information about the cases in 
which a specific connection was observed (Fig.  4 b),
 and clicking reveals further information, including an average 
connectivity profile, interactive visualizations of the data for each 
injection (Fig.  4c ) and metadata (Fig.  4 d).
 Summaries of the data and detailed information (such as 3-d maps of 
distributions of labeled neurons compatible with neuroimaging platforms,
 and the stereotaxic coordinates of each labeled neuron) can be 
downloaded for each injection separately, collated into a master 
spreadsheet (Quick links menu, Fig.  4 a), or accessed programmatically with a dedicated Application Programming Interface ( http://analytics.marmosetbrain.org/wiki/api ).    a  Connection strengths between areas (calculated as the mean FLNe).  b 
 The percentage of labeled neurons located in the supragranular layers 
(SLN). In these diagrams, each column represents the connections of an 
area that received at least one tracer injection, and the rows represent
 the projections from an area. The abbreviations of areas are provided 
in Supplementary Table  1 .
 Blank cells indicate connections that were not detected, and green 
cells denote intrinsic connections (not evaluated in the matrices). Rows
 annotated with hatched lines on panel  b  correspond to areas in 
which cells were not divided into supra- or infragranular due to the 
lack of a visible layer 4 (i.e. the entorhinal cortex [Ent], piriform 
cortex [Pir], amygdalopiriform transition area [APir], and subdivisions 
of area 29 [A29aac]).   This interface is available at  http://analysis.marmosetbrain.org .  a  Overview of the interface opened on the FLNe Graph tab, shown using an example area (area 8aV, part of the frontal eye field).  b  Closeups of the FLNe and SLN matrices (see Fig.  3

 Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas allows the analysis of global 
properties of area to area connectivity, as well as finer-grained 
analyses based on the locations of neurons. This raises the opportunity 
to test the often-made assumption that network properties which emerge 
from analyses of interareal connectivity matrices  32 , 33 , 34  
 reflect properties of the underlying cellular networks. As an example, 
we tested the hypothesis that neurons in primary sensory and motor areas
 tend to receive shorter-ranged connections, in comparison with those 
located progressively farther from their boundaries. This was initially 
suggested based on human functional connectivity, and later supported by
 analyses of macaque data  30 , 31 , 35  , but not yet tested at the level of neuronal populations.   The first step was to test if marmoset data reflect the features observed in the macaque  31  
 using an analysis based on areas. In this analysis, the distance to the
 nearest primary area represents the distance from the injection site to
 the border of the nearest primary area (for injections placed within 
primary areas this distance is 0). The connectivity distance of an 
injection is equivalent to the sum of the distances between the 
centroids of the target area and source areas, multiplied by the number 
of labeled neurons found in the source area, and divided by the total 
number of labeled neurons found in all source areas. A general linear 
model (GLM) was used to assess the relation between the distance to the 
nearest primary area (independent variable) and connectivity distance 
(dependent variable). The results in marmoset (Fig.  5 a)
 support the view that there is a significant increase in the average 
connection length received by an area as a function of its distance from
 the primary cortex (GLM,  F  3,143 a=a12.92,  p a&lt;a10 a3 ,  I2 a=a0.33, 95% CI [0.21, 0.45]). Averaging the results for all injections into the same area  31   yielded similar results (Fig.  5 b). The above analyses were based on the set of primary areas used in studies of human and macaque cortex  31 , 35  :
 V1, area 3 (A3a/A3b in the present nomenclature), the auditory core 
(AuA1, AuR, AuRT) and F1 (A4ab, A4c). As shown in Supplementary 
Fig.  4 ,
 the relationship between average connection length and distance to 
primary areas is robust irrespective whether the analysis is based on 
functionally defined primary sensory areas (e.g. including the gustatory
 cortex, Gu, and excluding the motor cortex and rostrotemporal auditory 
area, AuRT), or on koniocortex-type lamination (V1, AuA1, AuR, and A3b).    a ,  b 
 Analyses in which the locations of individual labeled cells are 
approximated by locations of centroids of the corresponding areas, using
 a general linear model (GLM) that incorporated covariates related to 
locations of areas (areas near the center of the cortical sheet being 
expected to show on average shorter connections than those located near 
the edges) and their different volumes (larger areas being expected to 
show longer average connections when intrinsic connections are 
excluded). Analyses based on individual injections ( a ) or averages of the results of injections in the same area ( b ) reveal similar trends.  c ,  d 
 Analyses using the locations of individual neurons (both intrinsic and 
extrinsic). Here, the GLM also incorporated covariates to account for 
injection volume and the mean distance to every voxel annotated as a 
cortical area.  e  Visualization of the results of the cell-based 
connectivity distance on a two-dimensional map of the marmoset brain. 
The green tones of each circle indicate results of the injection-based 
analysis, and background colors the averaged connectivity distance for 
injections in an area. Diagonal hatch indicates the primary visual area 
(V1), areas A3a and A3b, the auditory core (AuA1, AuR, AuRT), and 
primary motor cortex (A4ab, A4c), and gray shading indicates areas where
 no injections are available.  f ,  g  Comparison of average 
the length of supragranular (blue circles) and infragranular (red 
squares) afferents to the same areas. The ratio of the average length of
 supragranular ( d  s ) and infragranular ( d  i )
 afferents does not vary systematically with distance from primary 
sensory and motor areas. The abbreviations of areas are provided in 
Supplementary Table  1 . Source data are provided as a Source Data file.   We
 next tested if a similar relationship was observable if the exact 
stereotaxic locations of the neurons are used, instead of approximating 
locations of labeled neurons with centroids of cortical areas. To avoid 
bias due to the distances of cells in different layers of the cortex to 
the nearest white matter, the locations of individual cells (and 
injections sites) were projected to the nearest point on the 
mid-thickness surface of the template prior to other calculations. Here,
 the connectivity distance was estimated for each injection as an 
average length of simulated axonal tracts originating at the coordinates
 of each cell labeled by a given injection and terminating at the center
 of mass of the injection site. The pool of cells for each injection 
included both extrinsic and intrinsic labeled cells, but excluded those 
within a circular zone around the center of each injection. This zone, 
defined for each injection separately, was dictated by the volume of the
 injection site and of the region immediately around it, in which 
individual neurons cannot be plotted reliably (the average radius of the
 exclusion zones in our sample was 515aI 1/4 m; range 100a1100aI 1/4 m). The 
results (Fig.  5 cae)
 demonstrate that the relationship between connectivity distance and 
distance to the nearest primary area, first detected by an area-based 
approximation, reflects a genuine property of the cellular circuits of 
the cortex (GLM,  F  3,139 a=a9.10,  p a&lt;a10 a3 ,  I2 a=a0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]), and that this relationship is present (Fig.  5 f,
 g) both in connections formed by supragranular neurons (putative 
feedforward connections) and infragranular neurons (putative feedback 
connections  15  ).   Further examination of the data presented in Fig.  5 
 reveals that prefrontal areas are quite heterogeneous in terms of 
average connection lengths, with rostral and medial prefrontal areas 
(areas 32, 32V, and 46D on Fig.  5 e)
 showing increased emphasis on short-ranged connections relative to 
caudal prefrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal areas (e.g. areas 45, 
47L, and 8aV). This is the case despite the data showing that in the 
marmoset, as in the macaque  36 , 37 , 38 , 39  ,
 all prefrontal areas receive long-range afferent connections, which 
originate in areas of superior temporal, retrosplenial, posterior 
parietal, and caudal orbital cortex (Fig.  6 ).
 The difference in connectivity distance (A32: 2.9amm, A32V: 3.1amm, 
A46D: 4.2amm, against A45: 8.9amm, A47L: 6.3amm and A8aV: 5.9amm) is 
likely to reflect the closer link of caudal and ventrolateral prefrontal
 areas to cognitive functions associated with the analysis of ongoing 
sensory input, which is conveyed by long-range projections from the 
occipital, superior temporal and posterior parietal regions  37 , 40 , 41  .
 In comparison, the main functions of rostral and medial prefrontal 
areas are more closely associated with internally generated states 
including memory, value, and goals.   These are visualized in flat reconstructions available through the portal.  a ,  b  Results of retrograde tracer injection in medial prefrontal areas (A32V: area 32 ventral; A32: area 32).  c ,  d  Injections in rostral dorsolateral prefrontal areas (A46D: area 46 dorsal);  e a h 
 injections in caudal dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal areas 
(A47L: area 47 lateral; A8aV: area 8a ventral; A45: area 45). Even 
though long-range connections are a characteristic of all prefrontal 
areas, the medial and rostral areas ( a a d ) receive a higher proportion of their afferents from other prefrontal areas, in comparison with caudal areas ( e a h ). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.   The analysis illustrated in Fig.  5 
 also indicates that attributing single values to a cytoarchitectural 
area is unlikely to capture the local diversity of cortico-cortical 
connectivity. For example (Fig.  5 e), injection sites in area 47L tended to show a larger emphasis on shorter connections rostrally ( http://marmosetbrain.org ,
 cases CJ71-FR [4.9amm], CJ181-DY [3.8amm]) than caudally (CJ73-FE, 
7.9amm). The capabilities introduced by the present resource provide a 
basis for future refinements of cortical parcellation schemes in the 
marmoset, when used in conjunction with other anatomical and 
physiological criteria.   Large-scale
 networks characterized by co-activation measured by fluctuations in the
 BOLD signal have become an important concept in our current 
understanding of structureafunction relationships in the mammalian 
cortex  42  . These networks, which can be mapped in the resting brain, are selectively activated during different tasks  43 , 44 , 45  ,
 and previous studies in non-human primates have established a 
correlation between these and groups of areas which are preferentially 
interconnected at the cellular, monosynaptic levels  46 , 47 , 48  .
 It has been hypothesized that the large-scale networks of the primate 
cortex are organized in a nested structure, whereby those responsible 
for sensorimotor processing are characterized by predominantly 
short-range interactions with nearby areas, and those linked to 
progressively more abstract or multimodal processing show a 
progressively larger proportion of connections with distant areas. 
Moreover, in this model areas that are unique to the primate brain would
 be expected to show a predominance of long-range connections  30  .
 To test this hypothesis, we quantified the ratio of labeled neurons 
representing local to distant projections in areas identified as 
belonging to different functional networks in the marmoset brain.   In
 this analysis, local connections were defined as those originating in 
neurons within 4amm of the injection sites (a value sufficient to 
comprise all intrinsic connections, as well as projections from adjacent
 areas), whereas distant connections were those originating in cells 
located further than 8amm from the injection sites. We conducted this 
analysis using areas corresponding to five functional networks 
(Fig.  7 a) identified in the marmoset by neuroimaging experiments  45 , 48   and by correlation of data available in  http://marmosetbrain.org  with human neuroimaging  47  . The main hypothesis was upheld (Fig.  7 b):
 the ratio of local to distant connections decreased from the primary 
sensorimotor network (Pri), to a network formed by interconnected 
higher-order sensorimotor and premotor areas (HOSom), to a network 
formed by frontal and posterior parietal visuomotor integration areas 
(VisM), and finally to putative homologs of the human default mode 
network (cognitive control network, CON  45  , and apex transmodal network, APEX  47  ).
 APEX and CON have been hypothesized to correspond to components of the 
human default mode networks (DMNs A and B, respectively  48  ).
 There was no significant difference between the mean ratio of local to 
distant connections between CON/DMN-B and APEX/DMN-A, although areas 
comprising the latter tended to be more homogeneous in their 
connectivity ratio. This was the case even considering injections 
located relatively close to a primary sensory area (e.g. those in area 
TPO, which is located ~2amm from the borders of the auditory core).    a 
 Flat reconstruction of the marmoset cortex, showing the location of 
injection sites attributed to five networks of areas, defined in 
previous studies  45 , 47 , 48  .
 Pri (dark green): primary sensorimotor network (areas 3a, 3b, 4ab, and 
4c); HOSom (light green): a network formed by interconnected 
higher-order somatosensory and premotor areas (dorsocaudal premotor area
 [6DC], medial premotor area [6M], caudal ventral premotor area [6Va], 
dorsal cingulate motor area [24d], and parietal area PF); VisM (yellow):
 a network formed by higher-order visuomotor integration areas (lateral 
and medial intraparietal areas [LIP and VIP], caudal subdivision of PE 
[PEc], and putative subdivisions of the frontal eye field [8aV and 8C]);
 CON (orange): cognitive control network (putative homolog of the 
default mode network B, including frontal areas 8aD and 6DR, cingulate 
areas PGM and 23b, and ventral parietal areas OPt and PG); APEX (brown):
 apex transmodal network (putative homolog of default mode network A, 
including areas 10, 23a, TPO, PGa/IPa, and the rostral part of TE3, near
 the temporal pole).  b  Box plot (center line: median; box limits:

neurons located within 4amm of the center of the injection site (local 
connections) to neurons located &gt;8amm from the site (distant 
connections) following injections in the five networks (KaW: 
KruskalaWallis  H  test: 29.8, pa&lt; 10 a5 ). Statistical significance according to post-hoc Dunn's test:  p aa$?a0.05 (*),  p aa$?a10 a2  (**),  p aa$?a10 a3  (***). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.   We
 report on a resource for quantitative analysis of cortico-cortical 
connectivity in a non-human primate (the marmoset monkey), made 
available to the scientific community via an online portal ( http://marmosetbrain.org ).
 The resource is unique in several aspects compared to others presently 
available for the non-human primate brain. First, the data are provided 
both in an aggregated form (using traditional formats, such as FLNe and 
SLN matrices linked to cytoarchitectural areas) and according to the 
results of each experiment (via three-dimensional and unfolded views of 
the brain, as well as downloadable files). Second, it provides access to
 entire datasets through an online interface that allows the user to 
judge the location of each labeled cell relative to the cortical 
cytoarchitecture (areas and layers), as well as to assess the quality of
 the underlying materials at points of interest. Third, the results have
 been registered to a common template of the marmoset brain using a 
computational pipeline which facilitates immediate comparison of results
 obtained in different individuals, as well as combined analyses 
involving many cases. This pipeline is distinctive in that it includes 
defined steps for expert validation of the registration results, aimed 
at ensuring that the attribution of cells to areas was as accurate as 
possible, based on current knowledge about the histological parcellation
 of the marmoset cortex. In our experience, this careful curation is 
necessary when dealing with data obtained in a genetically heterogeneous
 population of non-human primate brains, particularly in order to 
minimize false positive reporting of connections due to registration 
errors. The estimation of distances based on biologically realistic 
assumptions (simulated white matter tracts) also provides a significant 
improvement over previous approaches based on Euclidean or geodesic 
distances across the cortical surface. The potential of the resource as a
 platform for discoveries has been already demonstrated by recent 
studies based on mining data on the spatial distribution of labeled 
neurons  21 , 47 , 48   and analyses of network properties  49  . The present release significantly expands this capacity.   In
 building the resource, we focused on retrograde tracers, which allow 
visualization of individual cell bodies relative to cortical layers. 
Thus, each cell location shown in  http://marmosetbrain.org 
 is akin to a quantum of connectivity, an approach that enables accurate
 quantification with current technologies. This approach, which is in 
line with earlier resources for the macaque brain  16  ,
 is scalable to a complete cortical connectome, including information 
about the reciprocity of connections, based on future experiments to 
encompass the entire cortex. In comparison, the use of anterograde 
tracers imposes significant challenges for quantification, related to 
visualization and identification of synaptic terminals, and to 
distinguish those from axonal fragments on the way to their 
destinations. A similar resource incorporating anterograde data may 
require future development of techniques for automated identification 
and quantification based on high-resolution images (e.g. those available
 at  http://marmoset.brainarchitecture.org ).
 Some limitations remain regarding the quantification of labeled neurons
 near the injection sites, where it is impossible to distinguish cells 
that formed projections from those which may have incorporated the 
tracer by passive diffusion. Here, our approach was conservative, and 
most likely resulted in under-estimation of the actual numbers of 
intrinsic connections.   One of the thorniest issues in neuroanatomy
 is the assignment of a given location to a specific cortical area. 
Areas with sharp, unambiguous histological boundaries are a minority, 
particularly among the association regions of frontal, parietal, and 
temporal cortex which experienced marked expansion in primate brain 
evolution  24  .
 This issue is not specific to the marmoset brain, as evident from the 
fact that widely used parcellations of the macaque cortex differ  16 , 25 , 26   and that estimates of the number of areas in the human brain have continued to increase  50  .
 Thus, unambiguous assignment of an injection site, labeled neuron, 
recording site, or activated voxel to an area is inherently uncertain. A
 tangible example of this problem relates to the quantification of the 
patterns of connectivity using matrices (e.g. Fig.  3 ).
 Such matrices provide convenient summaries of the data which are 
amenable to analyses (for example, based on graph theory), but should be
 interpreted with the biological reality of uncertain borders in mind. 
In the present resource, labeled cells and injections are assigned to 
specific cortical areas based on registration to the reference atlas  29  ,
 using a pipeline that ensured that clear cytoarchitectural boundaries 
were accurately represented (see section aMethodsa, aExpert-assisted 
registration to cortical areasa), but the definition of many other areas
 is less certain. In cases where the registration suggested that an 
injection involved more than one area, we assigned it according to the 
location of the injection barycenter. This decision was based on the 
fact that changes in the patterns of cortico-cortical connections do not
 occur abruptly at estimated borders, with gradual transitions of 
connectivity patterns often providing a better description  23 , 24 , 47 , 51 , 52  ,
 and that variations of patterns of connections also exist within single
 cytoarchitectural areas. Thus, excluding the data from injections that 
nominally crossed borders would imply a false level of precision, while 
resulting in selective reporting. Estimates of the percentage of 
injected voxels assigned to each area (Supplementary Table  3 ) and of the volumes of cortical areas  1   are both available, enabling estimation of the effect of injections across borders  6   and statistical modeling based on multiple injections grouped in different ways  53  .   The
 most important current limitation of the present resource is that it 
does not yet cover several groups of areas (e.g. those in the 
perirhinal, parahippocampal, insular, and anterior cingulate regions). 
This is being partially addressed by ongoing experiments which will be 
gradually released through the portal, but a more permanent solution may
 lie in a federated approach, whereby contributions from different 
laboratories can be integrated. Towards this end, the source code of 
both components of the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas is released 
under the GPL license (see aCode availabilitya section), and the present
 injections are indexed through other online resources (e.g.  http://marmoset.brainarchitecture.org , and  http://marmosetbrainmapping.org )  2 , 54  .
 Another limitation is linked to the realities of experimental 
neuroanatomy: the quality of the materials is variable due to factors, 
such as unintentional damage to the tissue during surgery or 
histological processing or sub-optimal staining of histological 
sections, which may limit the interpretation of data in specific 
regions. We made a decision to show the material in its entirety, awarts
 and alla, while including comments about known issues. We hope that 
this will allow users to make informed judgments on the suitability of 
specific materials to the analyses in mind while avoiding issues arising
 from selective reporting. The adoption of additional automation steps 
in the histological processing  2   will likely help address this limitation.   One
 of the desirable features going beyond the integration of additional 
materials would be the incorporation of probabilistic mapping of 
cortical areas, based on a template that reflects individual variability  55  .
 Presently the data are displayed and analyzed relative to the 
cytoarchitectural areas of a single brain examined in great detail  29  , an approach which has limitations  1  .
 In developing the resource we have incorporated steps where the results
 of the registration were subject to validation by a human expert, but 
this is admittedly not as readily scalable as other steps. Registration 
of the data to an average template of the brain, which incorporates 
probabilistic assignment of cortical areas to voxels, will facilitate 
principled analyses of the data collected through a fully automated 
pipeline, at least in terms of assignment of confidence intervals to 
inferences made based on the data. Another important development will be
 better integration of the datasets released through the present 
resource with those originating from magnetic resonance imaging, 
including diffusion imaging  54   and resting-state connectivity  39  .
 The precision of the non-invasive approaches for inference of neural 
connectivity has been questioned in terms of both sensitivity and 
selectivity  56 , 57 , 58  . Direct comparisons with the extensive ground truth data released through  http://marmosetbrain.org  provide a unique opportunity both to refine algorithms for MR image analysis, and to understand its limitations.   A position paper  5  
 which, in many ways, set the scene for the cellular-scale connectomic 
efforts of the present decade, proposed that this type of work should be
 based on experimental methods that are well-characterized, with 
individual steps for sample preparation, injection, histology, 
detection, and data analysis being stereotyped. The data collected from 
such an effort must be made freely available to all researchers from a 
centralized data repository, including raw image data, processed summary
 data, and metadata. The present resource provides the first large-scale
 platform for a non-human primate brain that allows quantitative 
analyses based on these principles. It will hopefully provide a fertile 
ground for future studies involving cellular connectivity, including 
comparative analyses with the comprehensive datasets being generated for
 the mouse and human brain using different techniques.   Release 1.0 of the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas ( http://marmosetbrain.org )
 includes the results of 143 injections of retrograde tracers in 52 
young adult (1.4a4.6 years, median age: 2.5 years) marmosets (31 male, 
21 female). Detailed metadata for each animal is available via the 
Metadata panel on the portal. All experiments conformed to the 
Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for 
Scientific Purposes, and were approved by the Monash University Animal 
Experimentation Ethics Committee  19 , 20 , 21 , 41  . Intramuscular (i.m.) injections of atropine (0.2amgakg a1 ) and diazepam (2amgakg a1 ) were administered as pre-medication, before each animal was anaesthetized with alfaxalone (10amgakg a1 , i.m.) 30amin later. Dexamethasone (0.3amgakg a1 , i.m.) and amoxicillin (50amgakg a1 ,
 i.m.) were also administered prior to positioning the animals in a 
stereotaxic frame. Body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygenation 
(pO 2 ) were continually monitored during surgery, and when 
necessary, supplemental doses of anesthetic were administered to 
maintain areflexia. Small incisions of the dura mater were made over the
 intended injection sites.   Six types of fluorescent tracers were used (Supplementary Tables  2  and  3 , Supplementary Figs.  1  and  2 ): fluororuby (FR; dextran-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine, molecular weight 10,000, 15% in dH 2 O), fluoroemerald (FE; dextran-conjugated fluorescein, molecular weight 10,000, 15% in dH 2 O), fast blue (FB, 2% in dH 2 O), diamidino yellow (DY, 2% in dH 2 O),
 and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, conjugated with either Alexa 488 
[CTBgr] or Alexa 594 [CTBr], 1% in PBS). The dextran tracers resulted in
 bidirectional transport, but only retrograde labeling is reported here.
 The tracers were injected using 25aI 1/4 l constant rate microsyringes 
(Hamilton, Reno, NV) fitted with a fine glass micropipette tip. Each 
tracer was injected over 15a20amin, with small deposits of tracer made 
at different depths. Following the last deposit, the pipette was left in
 place for 3a5amin to minimize tracer reflux. After the injections, the 
surface of the brain was covered with moistened ophthalmic film, over 
which the dural flaps were carefully arranged. The excised bone fragment
 was repositioned and secured in place with dental acrylic, and the 
wound closed in anatomical layers. Postoperative injectable analgesics 
were administered immediately after the animal exhibited spontaneous 
movements (Temgesic 0.01amgakg a1 , i.m., and Carprofen 4amgakg a1 , s.c.), followed by oral Metacam (0.05amgakg a1 ) for 3 consecutive days.   Survival
 times varied between 3 and 22 days (median: 15 days), after which the 
animals were anesthetized with alfaxalone (10amgaml a1  i.m.) and, following loss of consciousness, administered an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone (100amgakg a1 ,
 i.v.). They were then immediately perfused through the heart with 
500aml of heparinized saline, followed by 500aml of 4% paraformaldehyde 
(PFA) in 0.1aM phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The brains were 
post-fixed in the same medium for at least 24ah, and then immersed in 
buffered PFA with increasing concentrations of sucrose (10a30%). They 
were then sectioned (40aI 1/4 m thickness) in the coronal (most cases) or 
parasagittal (three hemispheres) plane, using a cryostat. One section in
 five was mounted unstained for examination of fluorescent tracers, and 
coverslipped after quick dehydration (2aAa100% ethanol) and defatting 
(2aAaxylene). Adjacent sections were stained for cell bodies (using the 
cresyl violet stain, or the NeuN stain  59  ), cytochrome oxidase, or myelin (for protocols, see Supplementary Table  2 ).
 The remaining section in each series was stored in cryoprotectant 
solution in a freezer, to be used as a backup in the case of 
unsatisfactory staining or damage during the processing of the 
histological sections. Hence, the spacing between adjacent sections in 
each series was 200aI 1/4 m. Stained sections were scanned using an Aperio 
Scanscope AT Turbo system (Leica Biosystems), providing a resolution of 
0.50aI 1/4 mapixel a1 . For cases with injections in the left 
hemisphere, the resulting images were flipped horizontally to preserve 
the common format of all cases and to facilitate comparisons.   Sections
 were examined using epifluorescence microscopes. Labeled neurons were 
identified using  A10 or  A20 dry objectives, and their 
locations within the cortex and subcortical structures were mapped using
 a digitizing system attached to the microscope. To minimize the problem
 of overestimating the number of neurons due to inclusion of cytoplasmic
 fragments, labeled cells were accepted as valid only if a nucleus could
 be discerned. This was straightforward in the case of DY, since this 
tracer only labels the neuronas nucleus  60  .
 In the case of tracers that label the cytoplasm (FB, FE, FR, CTBg, and 
CTBr), the nucleus was discerned as a profile in the center of a 
brightly lit, well-defined cell body, which in the vast majority of 
cases had an unmistakable pyramidal morphology.   We selected the Paxinos et al.  29  
 stereotaxic atlas of the marmoset brain as the three-dimensional 
reference space. The system of coordinates in this atlas is based on 
cranial landmarks: the horizontal zero plane is defined as the plane 
passing through the lower margin of the orbits and the center of the 
external auditory meatuses, the anteroposterior zero plane is defined as
 the plane perpendicular to the horizontal zero plane which passes the 
centers of the external auditory meatuses, and the leftaright zero plane
 is the midsagittal plane. The Nissl-stained plates illustrated in the 
PDF edition of the book (available at  http://marmosetbrain.org/reference ) were converted into a 3D template  1 , 61  .
 This resulted in a volumetric image of a resolution of 40aAa500aAa40aI 1/4 m
 (mediolateral, rostrocaudal, and dorsoventral, respectively) which 
preserves the stereotaxic coordinates of the source atlas plates. The 
atlas parcellation scheme consists of 116 cortical areas arranged in an 
ontology comprising 22 groups. The same scheme has been also adopted by 
other large-scale projects, such as BRAIN/Minds  62   and the NIH Marmoset Brain Atlas  54  , ensuring present-day interoperability.   To
 register the results of individual experiments into the reference 
template in a systematic and standardized way a computational workflow 
was established. The pipeline  1  
 computes a set of spatial transformations that allow expressing the 
location of any object of interest in the experimental data, such as 
labeled cell body or location of the injection site, within a common set
 of stereotaxic coordinates  29  .
 This process enables analyses of the connectivity patterns obtained in 
different cases using a common spatial and semantic reference. Three 
main steps can be distinguished: The affine reconstruction step, the 
deformable reconstruction, and the combined, affine and deformable, 
co-registration with the template image (Supplementary Fig.  5 CaE). The pipeline is based on the Possum 3D reconstruction framework  63   ( https://github.com/pmajka/poSSum ) and the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) software suite  64   ( http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/ ).   First,
 the images of the Nissl-stained sections were arranged in rostrocaudal 
order and edited so that only parts representing the brain tissue of the
 hemisphere to be reconstructed were preserved. The digitized locations 
of the labeled cells plotted on the fluorescent series were then aligned
 to adjacent Nissl sections (Supplementary Fig.  5 A).
 For the purpose of the 3D reconstruction, the high-resolution images of
 Nissl-stained sections are downsampled to 40aI 1/4 maAa40aI 1/4 m resolution to 
reduce the processing time without significantly hampering the mapping 
accuracy. The affine reconstruction step (Supplementary Fig.  5 C)
 recovered the overall anatomical shape of an individualas brain 
hemisphere. This was achieved by two alternating procedures: 3D 
registration of the reconstruction to the template, and 2D rigid 
alignment of the sectionsa images to each other  1 , 63  .
 This step restored the general shape of a hemisphere, but did not 
address noticeable transitions between consecutive sections caused by 
tissue distortions, which naturally occur during the histological 
processing. The deformable reconstruction step (Supplementary Fig.  5 D)
 reduced these distortions by deformably coregistering an image of a 
given section to a synthetic image obtained by averaging the images of 
neighboring sections  63  .
 This process produced a smooth reconstruction with a more natural 
appearance, which also facilitated the subsequent registration to the 
reference template.   In the last step, the reconstruction of a 
hemisphere was brought into the space of the reference template 
(Supplementary Fig.  5 E,
 F). This procedure mitigated the differences between the experimental 
and the template hemispheres by morphing the reconstruction to match the
 reference image, and minimized the influence of artifactual 
distortions, such as deformation of the surface due to the surgical 
procedures, or damage incurred during the extraction of the brain from 
the skull. Both the 3D reconstructions and the atlas image were 
resampled to an isotropic resolution of 75aI 1/4 m and smoothed with a median
 filter with a 1 voxel radius. During the affine step, the 
coregistration was driven by the Mattes mutual information  65  
 (MI) image similarity metric. For the deformable registration two, 
equally weighted, metrics were used: the cross-correlation coefficient  66   (CC) with a kernel size of 5 voxels, and the Point-Set Expectation  64  
 (PSE) metric, which forced corresponding label maps to overlap (see 
below). Overall, this process established a precise mapping between the 
experimental dataset and the template, which allows one to map the 
sections of a specific animal into the stereotaxic space.   To
 further increase the accuracy of the mapping (and, consequently, the 
assignment of the individual labeled cells to cortical areas) an 
additional processing step was introduced to the workflow initially 
described  1  .
 This procedure relied on guiding the registration to maximize the 
overlap of corresponding cytoarchitectural areas across individual 
experimental brains and the template brain.   Two sets of label maps
 were systematically outlined in each case, with each set given equal 
weight in driving the registration. The first set (Supplementary 
Fig.  6 A,
 B) was drawn on images of Nissl-stained sections downsampled to 40aI 1/4 m 
resolution, and highlighted the major morphological features of the 
brain, such as the ventral and dorsal banks and the fundus of the 
calcarine sulcus, lateral and medial banks and the fundus of the lateral
 sulcus, hippocampus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and claustrum. In 
addition, in the majority of the cases (45 out of 53), the outline of 
the entire cortex was delineated, thus ensuring that prominent 
morphological landmarks, such as the frontal, occipital, and temporal 
poles were precisely captured.   The second collection of label maps
 corresponded to the borders of individual cortical areas or aggregates 
of areas (Supplementary Fig.  6 C).
 These were traced on the set of sections used in the reconstruction by 
an experienced neuroanatomist (M.G.P.R.), using the information 
available from the entire set of histological sections for an animal 
(that is, the Nissl/NeuN, myelin, and cytochrome oxidase series). The 
process of establishing which areas were to be included was carried out 
iteratively for each case in the following way: (1) the outline of the 
cortex and the gross morphological landmarks were outlined, (2) the 
coregistration was carried out using a small number of histological 
areas, and the results were inspected, and (3) depending on the outcome,
 additional areas were added, and steps 2 and 3 were repeated until 
satisfactory results (i.e., no obvious assignment of labeled cells to 
incorrect areas, as determined by histology) were achieved.   In 
most cases, the registration was based on 14 histological labels 
distributed across the cortex, which included: The primary visual (V1) 
and somatosensory (A3b) areas, the middle temporal area (V5/MT), the 
combined extent of auditory core and belt areas (Aud), area prostriata 
(ProSt), the entorhinal cortex (Ent), the piriform cortex (Pir), 
parahippocampal area TH, the area 13 complex in orbitofrontal cortex, 
the area 3 complex in posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal area
 32V, dorsolateral prefrontal area 8b, the lateral intraparietal area 
(LIP), and temporal area PGa/IPa. Each of these areas, or groups of 
areas, could be unambiguously defined with high precision on the basis 
of having sharp architectural borders. In many animals, additional areas
 were used to drive the registration based on factors including markedly
 different sulcal morphology in regions of interest containing labeled 
neurons or injection sites, and persisting errors in the assignment of 
cells to areas which were obvious during successive manual inspection 
steps. The actual number of areas used for this purpose varied between 2
 and 22 in different cases, depending on the accuracy obtained with 
successive registration steps (Supplementary Fig.  6 C).   The
 locations of cells and injection sites were mapped into the template 
using the computed set of spatial transformations (Supplementary 
Fig.  5 G). Subsequently, they were assigned to a cortical area (or adjacent areas; see Supplementary Table  3 )
 based on the stereotaxic location of the corresponding voxel(s) 
relative to the atlas parcellation. As indicated in Supplementary 
Table  3 ,
 79 injection sites were entirely contained within estimates of a single
 cytoarchitectural area, 41 were &gt;80% contained within an area (i.e. 
well within the estimated precision of the method used to reconstruct 
boundaries), and 23 likely crossed borders. The assignment to an area 
was based on the voxel containing the injection barycenter, and 
validated by an expert. Estimated percentages of the voxels in different
 areas comprised by the injection sites are given in Supplementary 
Table  3 .   In
 addition to being assigned to an area, labeled cells were divided into 
either those above layer 4 (supragranular) or below it (infragranular) 
by a procedure that involved manual delineation of the granular cell 
layer across the entire set of sections that contained labeled neurons 
(Supplementary Fig.  5 I).
 Cells located in entorhinal cortex (Ent), piriform cortex (Pir), 
amygdalopiriform transition area (APir), and area 29a-c (A29a-c) were 
excluded from this assignment due to the lack of a visible layer 4. In 
the intermediate and medial sectors of the primary motor cortex (A4ab) 
and dorsocaudal premotor area (A6DC) the interface between layers 3 and 5
 was used for this purpose. The 3D locations, assigned areas, and 
laminar positions were stored in a database. Based on these data, the 
connectivity patterns obtained for each injection were quantified in a 
way similar to the one used in other studies involving injections of 
retrograde tracers  15   to assure compatibility and to enable cross-study comparisons.   Specifically, the strength of a directed connection to an injected area  A  from an area  B  was defined as the Fraction of Labeled neurons (extrinsic; FLNe), Eq. ( 1 ),    $${{\rm{FLNe}}}_{{B}\to
 {A}}=\frac{{\rm{Number}}\ {\rm{of}}\ {\rm{neurons}}\ {\rm{projecting}}\
 {\rm{to}}\ {\rm{area}}\ {A}\ {\rm{from}}\ {\rm{area}}\ 
{B}}{{\rm{Total}}\ {\rm{number}}\ {\rm{of}}\ {\rm{neurons}}\ 
{\rm{projecting}}\ {\rm{to}}\ {\rm{area}}\ {A}\ {\rm{from}}\ {\rm{all}}\
 {\rm{areas}}\ -{\rm{neurons}}\ {\rm{identified}}\ {\rm{in}}\ 
{\rm{area}}\ {A}}$$    
                    (1)
                   which yields values ranging from 0 to 1 for each projection. The within area connections (i.e. from area  A 
 to itself) weights were not considered. Furthermore, based on the 
established position with respect to the layer 4, the fraction of 
neurons which originate in the supragranular layers (supragranular 
neurons, SLN) of the source area was obtained according to Eq. ( 2 ).    $${{\rm{SLN}}}_{{B}\to
 {A}}=\frac{{\rm{Number}}\ {\rm{of}}\ {\rm{supragranular}}\ 
{\rm{neurons}}\ {\rm{projecting}}\ {\rm{to}}\ {\rm{area}}\ {A}\ 
{\rm{from}}\ {\rm{area}}\ {B}}{{\rm{Total}}\ {\rm{number}}\ {\rm{of}}\ 
{\rm{neurons}}\ {\rm{projecting}}\ {\rm{to}}\ {\rm{area}}\ {A}\ 
{\rm{from}}\ {\rm{area}}\ {B}}$$    
                    (2)
                   The FLNe and SLN values were calculated for
 each injection separately. For areas where multiple injections were 
placed, an average FLNe value was obtained using the arithmetic mean. A 
corresponding average SLN value was obtained by first summing 
supragranular and infragranular neurons across injections in which a 
specific projection was observed, followed by calculating the SLN off 
the obtained totals  15  .   Distances
 between cortical areas (interareal distances), as well as the distances
 between individual cells and injection sites, were estimated by 
measuring the lengths of simulated axonal tracts connecting these areas 
(Supplementary Fig.  3 ).
 The procedure stemmed from the assumption that, at the mesoscopic 
level, the brain organization follows the arrangement that minimizes the
 wiring length, or more generalathe wiring cost  67 , 68  .
 Therefore, we developed a computational model which assumes that 
hypothetical axonal bundles linking any two given points in the cortex 
minimize the wiring length by following the fastest (the least 
expensive, geodesic) possible trajectory through the white matter. This 
was accomplished numerically by assigning to each voxel of the 3D brain 
template a scalar parameter which expresses the ease with which a 
simulated fiber would traverse the said voxel. Fibers can pass through 
the white matter easily ( f  WM a=a1.0), while traveling across gray matter is difficult, yet still possible ( f  GM a=a0.05). On the other hand, reaching outside the brain is prohibited:  f  OUT a=a0.   To calculate the interareal distance matrix (Supplementary Fig.  3 D),
 for each cortical area its centroid (defined as the maximum of the 
signed distance transform applied to the binary mask of a given area) 
was established. Subsequently, three-dimensional geodesic trajectories 
connecting each pair of centroids were calculated using the Fast 
Marching  69   method implemented in the SimpleITK framework ( https://itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1FastMarchingImageFilter.html )
 taking into account the imposed constraints. To mitigate numerical 
errors, for each pair of areas trajectories in both directions were 
calculated (e.g. for areas MT and V2, the paths from MT to V2 as well as
 from V2 to MT were obtained). The length of each trajectory was 
measured, and the distance between areas  i  and  j  ( d   i  j  ) was defined as the average length of paths in both directions, Eq. ( 3 ).    $${d}_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}({d}_{i\to j}+{d}_{i\leftarrow j})$$    
                    (3)
                   The simulated tracts appear biologically plausible  70   (Supplementary Fig.  3 A,
 B). For instance, those connecting areas in close proximity are 
superficial to the interface between gray and white matter and form 
characteristic U-shaped trajectories, while those linking remote areas 
pass through deeper parts of the white matter. The trajectories in the 
opposing directions (i.e. from area  i  to  j  and from  j  to  i ) varied little in the vast majority of cases. The discrepancy (Supplementary Fig.  3 C)
 was a$?0.046 for 95% of the pairs of areas and a$?0.129 for 99% of the 
cases which illustrates the numerical stability of the method. 
Sporadically, however, due to the relatively large spacing between 
consecutive atlas plates (500aI 1/4 m), some numerical errors occurred 
causing trajectories in opposing directions to differ noticeably. 
Specifically, 15 pairs of areas have discrepancy larger than 0.3, the 
majority of which located in parts of the brain where the morphology 
changed rapidly in comparison with the spacing of the atlas plates. The 
interareal wiring distance matrix (Supplementary Fig.  3 D) comprises 6670 values ( n ( n  a 1))/2, where  n  is the number of cortical areas), distributed unimodally (Supplementary Fig.  3 E).
 The average interareal distance of 12.5amm is biologically plausible, 
comparable to the half of rostrocaudal extent of the marmoset brain 
(~30amm).   Finally, to eliminate bias resulting from choosing a 
specific relation between the ease of passing through the gray or white 
matter ( f  WM / f  GM a=a20) the analyses were repeated for  f  WM / f  GM 
 ratios ranging from 30 (a substantial difference between the gray and 
white matter) to 1 (tissue classes indistinguishable). The results were 
largely independent for  f  WM aaa f  GM  
ratios within a range that appears biologically relevant (10a30). Only 
when the difference between the tissue classes started effacing, the 
average interareal distance dropped sharply (Supplementary Fig.  3 F).   The
 primary experimental data, together with the results of the 
computational workflow described above, have been made open to the 
public by the means of the  http://marmosetbrain.org  portal. Supplementary Fig.  7 
 provides an abridged overview of the portal architecture, supporting 
infrastructure, and its relation to the computational pipeline described
 above.   The results generated by the data-processing pipeline (Supplementary Fig.  7 ,
 bottom left) are of a heterogeneous nature, including images, text, and
 tables, which calls for dedicated ways of handling each type in order 
to allow online sharing. The voluminous high-resolution images of 
histological sections are converted to JPEG 2000 format and transferred 
to the datastore. To facilitate responsive and fluent user experience 
when displaying the images online, they are handled by a dedicated image
 server (Djatoka,  https://sourceforge.net/projects/djatoka/ ) equipped with an elaborate caching and streaming mechanism to promptly access regions of interest at various magnifications.   Text and tabular data are stored in a master database (Supplementary Fig.  7 ,
 bottom right) and subsequently refined into static datasets, such as 
spreadsheets with quantified connectivity patterns, segmentation of the 
sections into cortical areas, compiled sets of metadata, static 
visualizations (e.g. spatial patterns of labeled cells presented as 3D 
images), etc. These datasets are made instantly available to the web 
server, eliminating the necessity of generating them upon useras 
request. Since the results are computed offline and only once throughout
 the entire infrastructure, the possibility of a discrepancy is ruled 
out and the chances of a failed request for obtaining a specific result 
are reduced. This arrangement noticeably simplifies continuous updates, 
expansion, maintenance, and curation of the connectivity atlas.   From the useras perspective, the  http://marmosetbrain.org  portal consists of two components (Supplementary Fig.  7 , top). The high-resolution section viewer employs the OpenLayers ( https://openlayers.org/ )
 framework to combine the high-resolution images with the non-imaging 
data, providing views of the primary experimental data. The 
complementary analytics interface provides the capability of exploring 
the quantitative results of the tracer injection experiments. Each 
component can be accessed either using a web browser or via a dedicated 
application programming interface (API), both offering access to the 
same range of data.   Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Research Reporting Summary  linked to this article.   The

The woman returned to the  Gold Coast  from  Iran  and is now being held in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital, Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said.   The confirmed case takes the number of Australians infected with the virus to 24.   Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure        Nine
 people have coronavirus in Queensland, including three who were 
evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan.   'If you have been overseas in the last 14 days and feel unwell please immediately see a doctor,' Dr Young said.   Queensland health minister Steven Miles said people shouldn't panic about the coronavirus.   'Queenslanders
 should be assured that our world class hospitals and our fantastic 
public health staff are ensuring Queensland is very well prepared for a 
possible outbreak,' he said.   Australia is already buckling under 
the weight of the coronavirus epidemic - with the stock market in free 
fall, supermarket shelves bare and a panic sale on flights.    With
 the world on the cusp of an unstoppable pandemic, experts warned every 
Australian could soon be struck down by the killer virus.   Families could soon see their supermarket bill balloon as worried households begin to stockpile food and medicines.    The
 Australian Securities Exchange has now fallen for the sixth straight 
session, shedding $221 billion - or 10 per cent - in just one week, 
including $72 billion on Friday morning alone.   It comes as the 
respiratory virus infected more than 82,000 people worldwide - including
 24 in Australia - causing 2,804 deaths.    The deadly strain, known now as Covid-19, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.    The economic plunge threatened to get even worse after  Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a coronavirus pandemic is 'very much upon us'.    Launching
 an emergency plan on Thursday afternoon, he said the government was 
identifying 'gaps in capabilities' within Australia's state-based health
 services.    As residents prepare for the epidemic to hit, 
with 23 people already struck down on Australian soil, there is already 
evidence of panicked stockpiling.    Travellers at Brisbane International Airport on January 29 (pictured)    Shocking photos emerged showing Woolworths shelves stripped of medicine, toilet paper and food staples.   Customers
 were greeted with near empty aisles when they arrived at the 
supermarket giant's Bondi store in Sydney on Thursday night.   The 
grocery store appeared to be struggling to keep the shelves stocked with
 paracetamol, toilet paper, tea, milk, pasta, oats and rice 
crackers.    Speaking
 to reporters in Canberra on Thursday afternoon, Mr Morrison confirmed 
Australia would operate as if coronavirus was already a pandemic.    'There is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus,' he said.   'And as a result, we have agreed today and initiated the implementation of the Coronavirus Emergency Response Plan.   'We
 believe that the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us and as a
 result, as a government, we need to take the steps necessary to prepare
 for such a pandemic.   'There is no need for us to be moving towards not having mass gatherings of people.    'You
 can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can 
still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to 
the concert, and you can go out for a Chinese meal.   'You can do 
all of these things because Australia has acted quickly, Australia has 
got ahead of this at this point in time.    'But to stay ahead of it, we need to now elevate our response to this next phase.'   Coronavirus fears wiped an incredible $72 billion off the Australian stock exchange on Friday morning.   It tumbled from a record closing high of 7,162 last Thursday to just 6,441 at 10am on Friday.   The dollar has fallen below 66 US cents for the first time in a decade.    Indicating
 that businesses are struggling, Air New Zealand slashed prices to 
Australia to just $69 on Friday morning in a bid to boost sales.   The
 airline is offering $69 one way flights from Christchurch to Melbourne,
 while fares for Auckland to Sydney and Brisbane will set Kiwis back 
$79.   It'll cost passengers just $69 to fly from Christchurch to Melbourne one way, and $79 to fly into Brisbane.   The cheap airfares are available for travel from mid-March.    Thanks
 to coronavirus travel bans, Air New Zealand, Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin
 Australia have reduced the amount of flights heading across the 
ditch.    But they are lowering ticket prices to fill up the remaining planes.   There are currently 23 cases of coronavirus in Australia, eight of which originated on the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship.   At
 least 621 people on the ship tested positive for the virus, officially 
named Covid-19, making it the biggest cluster outside China.   There were a total of 223 Australians quarantined on the ill-fated ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.    Worldwide, the virus has killed more than 2,800 people and infected 82,000.      NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      "

 Gold Coast beautician who was diagnosed with coronavirus after she 
returned from Iran could have infected up to 40 people in Australia.   The
 woman, 63, works at Hair Plus salon, in the Australia Fair shopping 
centre in Southport and fell ill at work on Thursday.    She is currently 'in isolation' at Gold Coast University Hospital, according to the state's health department.    Queensland's
 chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young said the woman did facials on 
up to 40 clients, with each one lasting around 15 minutes.   She warned that 'we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually'.    Health
 authorities are now desperately trying to track down the infected 
woman's customers to urge them to get tested.     A
 63-year-old woman diagnosed with coronavirus after returning from Iran 
gave facials to 40 clients at Hair Plus salon in Australia Fair Shopping
 Centre (pictured) on Thursday   Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   Queensland's
 chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young warned that Queensland 
was heading for an epidemic and urged Hair Plus customers to be examined
 for coronavirus   'She's a highly intelligent, very sensible 
lady, so as soon as she had her first symptom she spoke to her manager 
and she went home,' she told reporters in Brisbane on Saturday.   'Then she went to Gold Coast University Hospital and got tested.'   Dr Young urged anyone who attended the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair in Southport from 11am on Thursday to come forward.   'She saw a number of clients each for brief interactions, so we believe the risk is incredibly low,' she said.   Dr Young said there was no need for anyone who was at the shopping centre at the same time, to be concerned.   But she said the number of countries that have contracted the coronavirus is increasing each day.   'So it's very hard for individuals to work out which country is at risk,' she said.    'It's
 really a message now, if you have been overseas, you come back to 
Queensland, you feel unwell with any symptoms, that you go and get 
advice.'   Speaking to the  ABC , Dr Young warned that Queensland was heading for an epidemic.    'We know that we will be seeing a pandemic result through the world a it's not been declared yet,' she said.    'But we know we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually.'   The
 63-year-old beautician is currently 'in isolation' at Gold Coast 
University Hospital, according to the state's health department        Health
 minister Steven Miles reassured Queenslanders the Covid-19 virus 
remained contained across the state, despite the latest development.   A
 79-year-old west Australian woman has also tested positive after being 
evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan taking the 
overall number of infected Australians to 25.   According to the Australian health department there are 84,117 cases world wide and 2,872 reported deaths.   'The
 continuing increase in the number of cases and number of affected 
countries over the last few days are clearly of concern,' WHO chief 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said in Geneva.   He said that 24 
Covid-19 cases have now been exported from Italy - the worst-hit country
 in Europe - to 14 countries and that 97 cases have been exported from 
Iran to 11 countries.   The UN health agency had previously labelled the global risk as 'high' but still short of calling it a pandemic.    Health
 minister Steven Miles reassured Queenslanders the Covid-19 virus 
remained contained across the state, despite the latest development   The Australian government is already putting in place plans to tackle a pandemic.   In particular, it is looking at how aged care facilities could be locked down in the case of a coronavirus outbreak.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison says while some countries such as Japan are 
looking at closing schools, there is no need to do that in Australia 
based on current medical advice.   However, the virus known as COVID-19 affects the elderly more.   'The
 bigger impact would be in things like aged care facilities, the ability
 to lock those down, and to have the right care and support to those who
 are working in those places,' Mr Morrison said on Friday.     Travellers at Brisbane International Airport on January 29 (pictured)    Health
 ministers who met in Melbourne on Friday agreed the Commonwealth would 
take the lead on an aged care advanced planning process.   'Those 
who are elderly or those who have difficulties with their immune system 
are most at risk and that is why they are absolute top priority,' 
federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said.   Aged care providers 
received a letter this week from Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy 
outlining the need for them to have emergency plans in place.   'While
 the number of cases of COVID-19 is currently small in Australia, it is 
possible that this situation could change and services need to plan and 
be prepared for this,' he wrote.   Federal opposition frontbencher 
Jason Clare said the government is doing the right thing even though the
 WHO has yet to declare a pandemic.   'They have followed the advice

 travel ban comes after a Gold Coast beautician who had just 
arrived from the middle eastern country was diagnosed with 
COVID-19.    It emerged on Saturday that she could have infected up to 40 people while giving them facials.    The
 woman, 63, works at Hair Plus salon, in the Australia Fair shopping 
centre in Southport and fell ill at work on Thursday.    She is currently 'in isolation' at Gold Coast University Hospital, according to the state's health department.    Queensland's
 chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young said the woman did facials on 
up to 40 clients, with each one lasting around 15 minutes.   She warned that 'we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually'.    Health authorities are now desperately racing to track down the infected woman's customers to urge them to get tested.    A

 a highly intelligent, very sensible lady, so as soon as she had her 
first symptom she spoke to her manager and she went home,' Dr Young told
 reporters in Brisbane on Saturday.   'Then she went to Gold Coast University Hospital and got tested.'   Dr Young urged anyone who attended the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair in Southport from 11am on Thursday to come forward.   'She saw a number of clients each for brief interactions, so we believe the risk is incredibly low,' she said.   Dr Young said there was no need for anyone who was at the shopping centre at the same time, to be concerned.   But she said the number of countries that have contracted the coronavirus is increasing each day.   'So it's very hard for individuals to work out which country is at risk,' she said.    'It's
 really a message now, if you have been overseas, you come back to 
Queensland, you feel unwell with any symptoms, that you go and get 
advice.'   Speaking to the  ABC , Dr Young warned that Queensland was heading for an epidemic.    'We know that we will be seeing a pandemic result through the world a it's not been declared yet,' she said.    'But we know we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually.'    Health
 minister Steven Miles reassured Queenslanders the COVID-19 virus 
remained contained across the state, despite the latest 
development.    Queensland's chief medical officer Dr

conditions of the travel ban foreign nationals wanting to come to 
Australia from Iran will be required to spend a fortnight in a third 
country before being allowed into Australia.    Australians citizens who are returning from Iran will have to isolate themselves for two weeks after they return.    Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said there is likely a large number of undetected coronavirus cases in Iran.     Earlier
 this month the government issued a travel ban for foreign nationals 
wanting to travel to Australia from mainland China to spend two weeks in
 a third country.    That travel ban has been extended three times.    The

 coronavirus after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship
 in Japan, taking the overall number of infected Australians to 
25.    Of the reported cases in Australia all are either stable or recovered.       According to the Australian health department there are 84,117 cases world wide and 2,872 reported deaths.   'The
 continuing increase in the number of cases and number of affected 
countries over the last few days are clearly of concern,' WHO chief 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said in Geneva.   He said that 24 COVID-19 cases have now been exported from Italy - the worst-hit country in Europe - to 14 countries.    Also 97 cases have been exported from Iran to 11 countries.    As
 of Saturday, China, the epicentre of the outbreak, has the most cases 
at 79,000, while there are 3,000 reported cases in South Korea, 1,000 in
 Japan, and 900 in Italy.    Iran has 388 reported cases of COVID-19 and 34 reported deaths.    The World Health Organization is dispatching a team to Iran which is due to arrive on Sunday or Monday.     The UN health agency had previously labelled the global risk as 'high' but stopped short of calling it a pandemic.    Tehran

Queenslanders the COVID-19 virus remained contained across the state, 
despite the latest development    The Australian government, however, is already putting in place plans to tackle a pandemic.   In particular, it is looking at how aged care facilities could be locked down in the case of a coronavirus outbreak.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison says while some countries such as Japan are 
looking at closing schools, there is no need to do that in Australia 
based on current medical advice.   However, the virus known as COVID-19 affects the elderly more.   'The
 bigger impact would be in things like aged care facilities, the ability
 to lock those down, and to have the right care and support to those who
 are working in those places,' Mr Morrison said on Friday.     Travellers at Brisbane International Airport on January 29 (pictured)    Health
 ministers who met in Melbourne on Friday agreed the Commonwealth would 
take the lead on an aged care advanced planning process.   'Those 
who are elderly or those who have difficulties with their immune system 
are most at risk and that is why they are absolute top priority,' 
federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said.   Aged care providers 
received a letter this week from Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy 
outlining the need for them to have emergency plans in place.   'While
 the number of cases of COVID-19 is currently small in Australia, it is 
possible that this situation could change and services need to plan and 
be prepared for this,' he wrote.   Federal opposition frontbencher 
Jason Clare said the government is doing the right thing even though the
 WHO has yet to declare a pandemic.   'They have followed the advice
 of the chief medical officer ... they have followed the advice of the 
experts,' Mr Clare told ABC television on Saturday.       NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      "

 vigilante account on social media platform TikTok (pictured) has been 
removed by the platform after reports the page was a

 of the community are encouraged not to attempt to take the law into 
their own hands as this can jeopardise any subsequent investigations,' a
 police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.    Six separate 
videos show men being approached by the account holders and accused of 
trying to meet up with underage children they had 'met' online.    The
 account profile had a disclaimer on it reading 'innocent until 
proven guilty in a court of law' but none of the men had their faces 
censored in the videos.    One video garnered more than 50,000 views before the profile was taken down.      A TikTok spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the platform acted swiftly after they were made aware of the account.   'Promoting

 also do not permit users to encourage others to take part in dangerous 
activities, and we remove reported content or behaviour that violates

said he believed online vigilantism was the result of people feeling 
like police and government weren't doing enough.    'They think
 these are issues the government needs to deal with but are not, so they
 take justice into their own hands and use social media as a tool,' he 
told  LENS .    'They believe social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can help reach social justice.   'These people online are not doing it for fun, they might be doing it with a sense of justice.'    Criminologist

 were shocked to receive an email from Global Experience last week, 
requesting assistance to host students aged under-18 in the coming weeks
 who need to be in isolation for 14 days.   The email supplied to 
Daily Mail Australia claims the Department of Education was seeking help
 in finding families who could provide temporary accommodation for 
students before they return to school and their permanent hosts.   A
 student exchange company issued an appeal for host families to 
temporarily take in students aged under-18 returning from China (stock

 kindness and respect is appreciated for these students, as they would 
like to continue their studies in Australia as soon as possible.'   The
 email stressed the students aren't from Wuhan or Hubei province - the 
Chinese epicentre of the virus which has claimed more than 3000 lives 
worldwide, including one death in Australia.   Students were 
expected to self-isolate in their rooms, not spend time in public and 
requested to wear a mask when in shared areas of hosts' homes.   It comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia grew to 29 on Monday.   The startling email angered a previous Sydney host with three young children, who described the request as horrific.   One
 host contacted Daily Mail Australia to express their outrage and 
described the request a as irresponsible for putting Australia's health 
at risk (stock image)   'I was distressed that they were 
willing to put my family and the country at risk,' the anonymous host 
told Daily Mail Australia.    'It's irresponsible to put the public at risk like this.'   Requirements
 for students' temporary stay include a private bathroom for their 
exclusive use and three meals a day brought to their room.   Families would be paid up to $390 per week- around $100 more than the normal rate, the Sydney host claimed.   'Even
 if they tripled the amount, the fact they're offering more money to 
take in the students in and want us to put food at their door as if 
they're an animal makes it worse,' they said.   'It's not about the money, it's about keeping everyone safe, especially for those who have young children.'    The email requested assistance for hosts to temporarily take in students returning from China   Global Experience chief executive Sonia Ortega claims the response from host families has been more positive than negative.   'We're not forcing any families to take in these students,' she told Daily Mail Australia.   'All we've done is contact families to find who is willing and in a position to host.'   'We've
 received a few angry emails and we understand the concerns and fears 
they have. But we've received emails for many families who are more 
happy to help.'    Daily Mail Australia has contacted the NSW Department of Education for comment.    Out

 there are emerging hot spots elsewhere, with 21 people have died in

shelves emptied in Italian towns at the centre of the country's outbreak
 in the northern Veneto and Lombardy regions.    Mr Cooper said
 it was too early for such panic here but said Australians should start 
thinking about whether their food cupboards can sustain them if the 
supply chain is broken.   'You need to think about things that have a
 long shelf life: dried fruit, dried foods, cereals, pasta will also 
last a long time,' he said.   'Packets of flour will also allow to make your own bread.'   The

than protein, as the former should make up 80 per cent of our diet.   Empty

 plan should the spread turn into a pandemic - a development which would
 be declared by the World Health Organisation.   'Every part of the 
health system is now working on its plan so that we're ready if things 
develop further in the future,' chief medical officer Brendan Murphy 
said.      It comes as Australia's federal sports minister warned the nation's athletes could be pulled out of the Tokyo  Olympics  in July as the  coronavirus  continues to spread globally.    'Australian
 athletes are ready to make their mark at the Tokyo Olympics - but it 
should not be at the risk of their health and well-being,' sports 
minister Richard Colbeck said.   'We continue to work with the 
relevant authorities both here and overseas to ensure our athletes 
remain safe and protected as the response to the coronavirus continues.'   Australian athletes can also choose on an individual basis whether to compete in Tokyo.   The
 virus has infected 80,000 - including 690 passengers on board the 
Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Pictured are passengers 
disembarking the ship on February 21 after a two-week quarantine ended   The
 government's chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said it was
 unclear how safe Japan would be for those travelling to the Games at 
this stage.    'We still haven't seen the full impact of the 
Diamond Princess outbreak - we're making a daily evaluation of the 
effects,' he said.    The worrying government comments follow 
Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates saying last week that
 organisers found no case for postponing or cancelling the Games.   In the past week, it emerged seven people had died and 229 are infected after an outbreak of the virus in Italy.    A
 third Victorian passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship has 
tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the state's total number of cases
 to seven, chief health officer Brett Sutton confirmed.   The trio were repatriated to Victoria and are recovering in isolation.   Four people who previously tested positive for the virus in Victoria have recovered, the state's health department said.

 supermarkets throughout Australia are running out of stock as customers
 panic buy supplies amid a potential coronavirus outbreak.    The deadly virus has infected an estimated 90,149 people across 76 countries and killed more than 3,000 - mostly in mainland  China .   But
 as more cases are diagnosed outside China, particularly in Iran, Italy 
and the United States, authorities are increasingly concerned about the 
threat of a worldwide pandemic.   Australia's Chief Medical Adviser 
on Monday warned the nation's strategy no longer includes trying to stop
 the spread of coronavirus in Australia.   The aisles in Coles in Claremont, Perth were unusually empty on Saturday as shoppers stockpiled the essentials   One shopper was shocked to realise her local supermarket in Hornsby, Sydney, was entirely sold out of pasta    A Costco in Casula, Sydney, sold out of all toilet paper and bulk bottles of water this week   Instead,
 authorities are putting certain travel bans in place and taking the 
necessary precautions to slow the inevitable spread.    In response to a potentially catastrophic outbreak, Australians have been racing to stores to prepare for the worst.   Pasta,
 tinned food, bottled water, toilet paper and hand sanitiser have been 
the most in-demand items at supermarkets across the nation - and plenty 
of stores aren't able to keep up with demand.   One Woolworths employee said during his shift, he is constantly getting queries about bulk buying options.   'I work at Woolies packing shelves, I am getting so many requests for 10kg rice, canned vegetables and tuna,' he said.    'As
 soon as we put some on the shelf they are snatched away, I assume this 
is all due to the first Australian death to the Coronavirus.'   Others
 shared photos of bare shelves in Costco stores in Sydney, claiming 
customers were heading there to strip the shelves of bulk packets of 
toilet paper and bottled water.     Westfield Booragoon, in Perth, also experienced bare supermarket shelves after customers began stockpiling   The global coronavirus death toll surpassed 3,000 following a sudden spike in Italian cases   Woolworths in Doncaster, Melbourne, was stripped bare this week as shoppers stocked up on supplies   On Saturday, Coles in Claremont, Perth, was brimming with people as they stocked up on what was left in store.       Throughout the region grocers and pharmacies have run out of hand sanitiser. Some stores don't expect more stock until mid week.   One shopper said the hysteria surrounding the outbreak was most concerning.   'There's so many people grabbing stuff. It's kind of intimidating,' Lucy Bell told  7News .   'It kind of worries me, seeing that.'    Pictured: Brisbane Woolworths with pasta shelves entirely empty    Customers in North Sydney were 'disgusted' at the low supply levels in store when they went to do their groceries    Some stores claim they won't be able to restock essentials until mid week.

 of Australia's leading survivalists said people should start bulking up
 their weekly shop before the virus' spread leads to food supply 
shortages.   'We should always be prepared for food shortages - not 
just from coronavirus but civil incidences, extreme weather and power 
outages which will cut us off from supply,' Western Australian survival 
instructor Bob Cooper told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.    Mr
 Cooper said Australians should start thinking about whether their food 
cupboards could sustain them if the supply chain is broken.   'You 
need to think about things that have a long shelf life: dried fruit, 
dried foods, cereals, pasta will also last a long time,' he said.   'Packets of flour will also allow to make your own bread.'   The hysteria comes as Australia recorded its first coronavirus death on Sunday.    A
 78-year-old man who contracted coronavirus on board the Diamond 
Princess cruise ship off Japan boarded the doomed cruise in Perth with 
his wife Iris, who also contracted the virus.   The man died at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital early on Sunday morning after being flown to Perth on February 21.   Australia
 has also recorded its first human-to-human contact. A doctor in a 
western Sydney hospital contracted the virus from a man who returned 
from Iran.    Lucy Bell (left) was shopping at Coles in Perth and said watching all the panic buying made her nervous   Stock in Tasmanian supermarkets is also running low as people stock up on the basics      NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25      January 27       VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29      January 30     February 1       February 22        QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5       February 6     February 21           SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      "
1471551053,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/even-as-behavioural-researchers-we-couldnt-resist-the-urge-to-buy-toilet-paper,2020-03-05,Even as behavioural researchers we couldn't resist the urge to buy toilet paper | Liam Smith and Celine Klemm," If you asked someone how much toilet paper they have in their home right now, Iam sure they could accurately tell you.   Did we ever think we would see a day when supermarkets would impose 
buying restrictions on toilet paper? It seems ridiculous, right? But the
 past few days have seen nervous customers panic-buying essential items 
such as toilet paper, canned goods and rice, leaving supermarket shelves
 bare. Some stores have even sold out of pet food and kitty litter.   As two behavioural scientists, wead both heard about toilet paper 
being sold out but largely dismissed it as a passing anomaly. But upon 
visiting a local supermarket, sure enough, the shelves were empty.   Neither of us had intended to get caught up in the hype but then 
asked each other ... if there was a packet left or if we happened to be 
there when they were restocking the shelves, would we have bought 
additional toilet paper? Of course we would. Why? Despite studying 
behaviour for years, our own reaction came as a surprise, especially 
since we both still had at least a weekas worth in our respective 
houses.   But, with further thought, the behaviour is largely explainable (behavioural scientists are very good at explaining behaviour  after  the fact!):   Itas seen as an essential product, without ready substitutes. In many
 ways, toilet paper is similar to essential services. Imagine that the 
water utility told you they were cutting off the water in your 
neighbourhood for an undetermined period. Iam sure theread be a surge in
 water tank sales and that baths, sinks and buckets would be filled.   Toilet paper is easily stockpiled and doesnat deteriorate. Itas 
relatively a low cost/low risk investment and even if you have 
stockpiled, itas something you will eventually use. Given weare aware of
 people in quarantine for two weeks or longer, it makes sense to 
stockpile non-perishables in case this happens in Australia.   In light of the first two reasons, buying toilet paper is an action 
that people can take now. The media (especially social media) may have 
made people feel helpless about the imminent arrival of Covid-19.   The virus has all the characteristics that make it scary a itas 
novel, invisible, we have no control, we are involuntarily exposed to 
the risk, it makes us feel dread and we are personally vulnerable. As 
box ticking goes, this one is right up there.   While there is some guidance on what individuals can do about it 
(thorough hand washing and avoiding people), the media reminds us 
continually of the relentless path. Buying toilet paper  alleviates some of this anxiety and helps us regain control.    Social media amplifies the fear which, in some way, seems to travel 
faster than the virus. The hashtags #toiletpapercrisis and 
#toiletpapergate were trending on Twitter. Seeing image after image of 
empty shelves sends signals to the public that this is an important 
issue everyone is talking about. Whatas key to understand here is that 
media typically serves as a surveillance function, alerting us to risks 
that we need to shield ourselves from.    The supermarket shelf itself also sends signals. Toilet paper is 
bulky and, as itas removed, the shelves look empty quickly, which 
triggers the perceptions of scarcity. In reality, the situation appears 
worse than it actually is.   We psychologically respond to scarcity. We hate missing out so when 
things are rare, particularly things we need, we chase them. Emotions 
can play a powerful role here. Weave all been in a situation where weave
 missed out on something we thought we should buy, and felt remorse. In 
behavioural sciences, this is known as anticipated regret and, if you 
can get people to feel it, itas a powerful motivator. By making the 
purchase, in some small way we protect ourselves from this feeling of 
regret.   Humans are finely attuned to monitoring what everybody else is doing 
(even subconsciously). Most of us use awhat other people doa as a mental
 shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are
 unsure. Itas a simple decision mechanism called asocial proof 
heuristica, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For 
instance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, 
because it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are 
also more likely to reuse their towels if told that athe majority of 
guests reuse their towelsa. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet 
paper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help 
decide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.   We use this same principle of social proof when judging risk. Think 
of a situation where you hear an alarm go off. Most of us will instantly
 look around to see what others are doing, and to decide whether this is
 something to be taken seriously. If everyone reacts then we will tend 
to do the same.   Experts and governments have been telling us about pandemic 
preparedness, weave been urged to prepare as the widespread message has 
been that health systems across the world will struggle to cope. 
Everything gives the signal to prepare. So is anyone surprised when we 
see people panic-buying essentials?   There are at least three factors driving our response a scarcity, 
social proof, and regaining a sense of control. Itas scary how strong 
these influences are on our behaviour. Stockpiling is not needed, yet we
 still have the urge to do it. As behavioural researchers, we intimately
 know the forces acting on us, yet weare helpless to resist them.    aC/  Professor Liam Smith is the director of BehaviourWorks Australia, Monash Sustainable Development Institute    aC/  Dr Celine Klemm is a research fellow at BehaviourWorks Australia   "

According to News Corp a one of the major shareholders who actually 
took the decision to close AAP a the shuttering of the vital news 
service is the fault of digital giants Google and  Facebook  a| and the ABC and Guardian Australia. Wait. What?   In the fallout over AAP in the last few days, News Corp has used its 
significant real estate to attack both media organisations, with 
articles appearing in the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and  other Murdoch titles  shifting blame to competitors.   A page three story in the Australian on Friday accused Guardian 
Australia of agobsmacking hypocrisya for reporting that, along with the 
very compelling financial reasons for closing the service, News Corp and
 Nine told staff they  no longer wanted to subsidise  a breaking news service for their competitors. Neither News nor Nine have denied making the comments.   The AAP chairman, Campbell Reid, fired off a statement after the 
Guardian report saying it was aone of the very companies that slashed 
the amount it was prepared to pay for AAPa.   A senior executive for News Corp, Reid is also furious with the media
 union, the MEAA, for questioning News Corpas motives for suddenly 
closing the wire service and throwing 600 people into unemployment.   Guardian hypocrisy over AAP shutdown  https://t.co/bonD9uUIdh    a[The Guardian] is one of the organisations whose decisions have 
contributed to the closure of AAP and it and the [Media Entertainment 
and Arts Allianceas] leadership should confront the bigger, tectonic 
forces our entire industry faces rather than trot out this arrant 
nonsense,a  Reid thundered.    Guardian Australiaas editor, Lenore Taylor, who was not given a right of reply by the Oz,  says: 
 aWe were offered a discount by AAP when we renegotiated last year 
because we were using fewer services as we expanded our own reporting 
teams.a   aMr Reidas statement is based on false premises,a Taylor said on 
Twitter. aNo one at Guardian Australia has ever suggested the decision 
to close AAP was made primarily to hurt small media organisations. We 
have written that it was a commercial decision. We did publish what Mr 
Reid TOLD staff at AAP a that as well as commercial considerations, News
 and Nine felt they were propping up a news wire that helped 
competitors.a   via  @p_hannam   pic.twitter.com/HJK4anovx0    Then there was that other whipping boy, the public broadcaster. An 
editorial in the Daily Telegraph argued that Auntyas free content was 
cutting their lunch.   aAdditionally, AAP found itself competing with an ever-expanding ABC,
 which in defiance of the public good and media viability now dominates a
 great deal of the online realm through tax-funded content,a editor Ben 
English editorialised.   aThe forthcoming loss of AAP will be a crushing blow to media 
diversity, brought about by behemoth organisations that care little for a
 plurality of sources.a   We know that News Corp is responsible for much of the climate denial published in the Australian media a  no matter what Rupert Murdoch claimed  a but now we have some hard data to put it in context.   First the good news. Reporting on bushfires is now far more likely to
 mention climate change, a study by Monash University has found.   The  report from the Monash Climate Change 
 Communication Research Hub, found that 49% of the media coverage of the
 recent bushfires mentioned climate change, compared with 5% of reports 
about Black Saturday in 2009.   The researchers analysed 1% of articles between 1 September and 31 
January and found only 5% of overall coverage featured climate 
denialism, down from 21% in 2009.   But it was News Corp publications that represented 59% of all the 
denialist discussion of climate change. The former Fairfax papers, now 
owned by Nine Entertainment, made up 19% of denialism.   The coverage of protests by school children and Extinction Rebellion 
showed that, of the 2% of articles that criticised the actions of the 
protesters, a whopping 84% appeared in News Corp.   The ABC wants the government to reverse its decision to impose an 
$84m indexation pause, an unlikely outcome with the details of cuts to 
staff and services due to be unveiled this month and no sign of the 
government softening.   But before the ABC managing director, David Anderson, could make a 
final plea to parliamentarians on Tuesday, the delicate 
behind-the-scenes negotiations between the communications minister and 
the ABC were leaked to the papers a twice.   A letter written by the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, to Anderson appeared in the  pages of the Sydney Morning Herald . Fletcher had astrongly urgeda the ABC to consider selling its capital city offices to cope with the $84m budget cut.   Anderson addressed the suggestion in Senate estimates later that day,
 saying the property portfolio had been examined many times and the idea
 was not new.   He also told senators the summer bushfires added an extra $3m in 
emergency broadcasting costs to the ABC budget at a time when the 
corporation had to absorb an ongoing annual budget cut of $105.9m.   That $105.9m figure represents all the cuts the Coalition has made to
 Aunty between 2014, when Tony Abbott promised no cuts to the ABC or 
SBS, and 2022, when the indexation pause ends.   The next day the Australian had another leaked letter, this time from
 Anderson to Fletcher. Anderson said if the government reversed the cuts
 the corporation would find $10m to fund additional regional services.   Alas, weare digesting our own aindexation pausea 
budget cuts .. $84 million over three years, more jobs in the industry 
will be lost.  https://t.co/S1qHcGF6by    aIf indexation was restored, combined with savings and efficiencies 
that the ABC has identified in recent months, the corporation would be 
in a position to commit an additional investment of up to $10m per annum
 to employ more journos in regional Australia and generate more content 
from regions for local and international stories,a the MD wrote.   With the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, angrily insisting it was 
an aindexation pausea and ABC executives saying it was a cut, we canat 
see the negotiations being successful.   The ABCas editorial director, Craig McMurtrie, was grilled at 
estimates about whether there had been any political interference in ABC
 News in relation to a report about sports rorts and another about a 
Rural Fire Service volunteer, Paul Parker, who told the prime minister 
to aget fucked from Nelligena in a viral news clip.   ABCas Media Watch revealed last month that a news story about Parker 
was filed for the ABCas 7pm bulletin but didnat run. Then the story was 
slated to run on News Breakfast, only that didnat run either. ABC 
management told Media Watch it had nothing to do with politics and 
everything to do with aaccuracy, newsworthiness and prioritiesa.   Why the ABC spiked an exclusive interview with the volunteer firefighter who abused the PM on national TV.  #MediaWatch  https://t.co/YaYWzg7xVz   pic.twitter.com/CPWKrAM9XI    McMurtrie told senators the story didnat run on the news bulletin 
because it was unclear whether he had been sacked or was stood down. At 
the next opportunity the story wasnat run because the anews cycle had 
moveda, he said   aThe important thing was that the newsroom had made the call and there was no pressure or intervention,a McMurtrie said.   What did emerge from the exchange was that Anderson has never had a 
call from Scott Morrison personally a but he has received emailed 
complaints from the PMas office.   Anderson said the PMO emailed him about a story on the Lilli Pilli 
sports club, and after the story was examined it was amended and a 
correction published because it was based on a false assumption in a 
Facebook post. The story didnat meet ABC editorial standards, McMurtrie 
said, and it had nothing to do with political influence.   aOn 20 January, ABC News Online published a story that suggested the 
Lilli Pilli Soccer Club may have had prior knowledge of a Sport 
Australia grant for the second stage of the expansion of its clubhouse,a
 the ABC correction says. The ABC accepts that was not the case.a   Journalists snickered on Monday when a media release arrived in their inboxes trumpeting a world-first event: the first  official KFC wedding.

guests to the KFC Wedding complete with the KFC Food Truck, personalised

had the last laugh. Multiple Australian and international outlets,  including news.com.au ,  7news.com.au ,
 the Daily Telegraph, 10 Daily, Pedestrian TV, Toowoomba Chronicle, the 
Courier Mail and KIIS 1065 covered the stunt, complete with multiple 
pictures and video. Most stories had bylines, and some were even 
pay-walled. Expect more of this press-release journalism when AAP 
shutters in June.   Before we leave the subject of dumb press releases the great toilet 
paper shortage provided some publicists with priceless opportunities to 
flog their clients. We heard from one PR agent on behalf of a 
manufacturer of bidets. She wondered if Weekly Beast would like to 
interview him: aIn light of the toilet paper shortage over coronavirus

      Over the past two decades significant changes in approaches to gender
 equity have taken place in the fields of contemporary music and music 
research. However, women in music are still disadvantaged in terms of 
income, inclusion and professional opportunities. In Australia a 
national approach to improving gender equity in music has begun to 
emerge as once-controversial strategies trialled by four tertiary 
institutions have become established practices. This article discusses 
successful inclusion strategies for women in music, including the 
commitment to gender-balanced programming across all concerts at 
Queensland Conservatorium of Music by 2025, the introduction of 
mandatory quotas in recital programmes at Monash University, mentoring 
programmes for women composers at Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and 
the development of coursework devoted to women in music at The 
University of Western Australia, as well as other initiatives that have 
emerged from them, both within and beyond the institution. Each approach
 is examined in the context of broader global discussions around gender 
and feminism. The public willingness to engage in discussions over 
sexual harassment, sexual assault and gender discrimination in the 
workplace that has resulted from the #MeToo movement is cited as key in 
influencing the engagement of students and professionals with these 
strategies and subsequent influence on performance practices, project 
development and presentational formats in new music.   COPYRIGHT: A(c) Cambridge University Press 2020     A

Expert reveals if virus is seasonal,"    PUBLISHED:    09:44, Fri, Mar 6, 2020        | UPDATED:  11:01, Fri, Mar 6, 2020       Coronavirus 
 outbreaks are continuing across the globe, with 115 cases now confirmed
 in the UK. On Thursday, a woman with underlying health conditions 
became the first person in the UK to die after testing positive for 
coronavirus. The woman was being treated at the Royal Berkshire Hospital
 in Reading and is believed to have caught the virus in the UK.   As the number of cases continues to rise across the globe, can we expect the outbreaks to end come the summer months?   COVID-19,
 the strain of coronavirus currently infecting people, will likely end 
up being a seasonal infection, much like other coronaviruses, according 
to Professor Stephen Turner of Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, 
Monash University.   He explained: aGiven many people have been 
previously exposed and are likely immune, then spread of these seasonal 
coronaviruses is more likely during winter months where conditions and 
behaviours favour transmission (e.g. a higher density of people staying 
indoors and in close proximity more often during the winter).   aHowever,
 before this the COVID-19 will still have to run its course (i.e. spread
 globally). Once immunity is established in the broad population, it 
will likely go seasonal.a    READ MORE:   Coronavirus UK: How many are ill? How many have died? First UK victim confirmed             Coronavirus: Will the outbreak end in warmer weather?  (Image: GETTY)     A major reason for worry at the moment, according to professor Turner, is the scale of new infections.   He
 said: aThe global population is susceptible given this is a new virus 
introduced into human circulation and capable of human to human 
transmission.   aWhile most people will only get mild symptoms (or 
even no symptoms), there will be a small fraction of individuals who 
will react severely.   aThis equates to a large number of people if the majority of the population is susceptible.a    DON'T MISS    He
 added: aGiven the rapid spread, an uncontrolled outbreak can easily 
overwhelm health services (there are only a certain number of beds in 
ICUs to help people with severe respiratory disease).   aSlowing the
 spread therefore might not stop people getting infected but it will 
help authorities cope with those with severe infection.a   To help slow down the spread of coronavirus, health officials are urging people to practice good hygiene.   The NHS is advising people to wash their hands with soap and water often, for at least 20 seconds.           Coronavirus: Professor Turner says the virus will likely end up being a seasonal infection  (Image: GETTY)     People
 should always wash their hands when they get home or into work, and use
 hand sanitiser gel if soap and water arenat available.   The health
 body also advises covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your 
sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze.   You should put 
used tissues int he bin straight away and wash your hands afterwards, 
and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell.   You should avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.

been tested for the virus. On Thursday, the UKas first 
coronavirus-related death was announced - a woman in her 70s who also 
hide underlying health conditions. And on Friday a man in his 80s with 
underlying health conditions became the second person in the UK to die 
after testing positive for the virus.   Across the globe people have been stockpiling medicines, food, hand sanitiser and even toilet roll.   Many
 people on social media have also suggested stocking up on vitamin C - a
 vitamin which some health experts claim helps fight cold and flu and 
gives the immune system a boost.   But is vitamin C actually effective when it comes to coronavirus?   According to Professor Stephen Turner of Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, the answer is no.    READ MORE:   Coronavirus test: How do they test for coronavirus?             Coronavirus update: Should you stockpile vitamin C?  (Image: GETTY)     He
 said: aThere is little evidence that taking supplements actually helps 
with preventing or limiting virus infections if you are already healthy.   aIf
 you are healthy, then most of the excess vitamins are excreted by your 
body pretty quickly. Hydration is key while appropriate medicine can 
alleviate symptoms (e.g. aspirin, paracetamol).a   On Question Time this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, said there was aabsolutely no needa for people to buy in excess.   aThe
 government has supplies of the key things that are needed. And within 
the food supply, we are absolutely confident that there won't be a 
problem there,"" he said.    DON'T MISS    aCrucially,
 we are working with the supermarkets to make sure that, if people are 
self-isolating, then we will be able to get the food and supplies that 
they need.""   Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, 
also said there was ""no need"" for the public to stockpile food or 
medicine, adding that the outbreak would be a ""marathon not a sprint"".   The
 government has assured people it has a stockpile of important medicines
 and protective equipment to counter any impact to global supply chains.   Alongside
 a keep calm and carry on attitude, Britons are being asked to carry out
 preventative methods to slow the spread of the virus.           Coronavirus update: Experts say there is little evidence taking supplements helps prevent viruses  (Image: GETTY)     People
 are being asked to wash their hands more often than usual, for 20 
seconds, and whenever they get home or into work, blow their nose, 
sneeze or cough, or eat or handle food.   Face masks have soared in 
popularity since the first cases of coronavirus were reported, but 
health officials say while they play a very important role in places 
like hospitals, there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for 
members of the public.   How do you know if you have coronavirus?   The three main symptoms of coronavirus are:           Coronavirus update: health officials in the UK say there's no need to stockpile  (Image: GETTY)     The NHS advises: aBut these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.   aThe symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu.   aItas
 very unlikely to be coronavirus if you have not been in close contact 
with someone with confirmed coronavirus, or you have not been to a 
country or area with a high risk of coronavirus in the last 14 days.   aIf you think you might have coronavirus, use the  NHS 111 online coronavirus service  to find out what to do.a  "
1474924382,http://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/08/patriarchy-and-power-how-gender-inequality-underpins-abusive-behaviour,2020-03-07,Patriarchy and power: how gender inequality underpins abusive behaviour | Jess Hill,"   I  nvestigative journalist Jess Hill 
interviewed dozens of abused women, domestic abuse sector workers, male 
perpetrators, childrenas advocates and system experts over five years in
 order to write her award-winning book, See What You Made Me Do. Here 
she answers some questions about issues arising from the murders in 
Brisbane of Hannah Clarke and her three children Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4 
and Trey, 3.    Hannah Clarkeas family described her husband Rowan Baxter as 
controlling, coercive and obsessive. His abuse appears to have followed a
 familiar script known as coercive control. Can you explain this?    Coercive control is a very particular kind of domestic abuse. Itas 
not a areactiona to stress, nor is it triggered by alcohol or drugs. 
Itas an ongoing system of control, in which the abusive partner seeks to
 override their partneras autonomy and destroy their sense of self. The 
end game a whether the perpetrator knowingly sets out to achieve it a is
 to make their partner entirely subordinate; a awilling slavea. To do 
this, they isolate, micro-manage, humiliate, degrade, surveil, gaslight 
and create an environment of confusion, contradiction and extreme 
threat. The feeling victims have, as the British survivor-advocate Min 
Grob tweeted the other day, is that the rug has been pulled from under 
your feet. aYou become disoriented, hyper vigilant, confused and most 
likely sleep-deprived. You are walking on eggshells. Afraid youare going
 mad. Afraid to make them mad. Afraid. All the time. Sometimes not even 
knowing why youare in fear but the panic is there. Always.a This abuse 
can also be incredibly hard for the victim to detect, because it happens
 slowly, bit by bit. Itas the total mental dislocation of coercive 
control a which Amnesty International has classified as torture a that 
is the hardest thing to recover from.   Coercive controllers may use extreme physical or sexual violence; or,
 as was reportedly the case with Rowan Baxter, no physical violence at 
all. For more than 40 years, women and children have been saying that 
except for extreme violence, the coercive control is the worst part. In 
fact, one of the most common refrains from victims of coercive control 
is aI wish head just hit mea.    If domestic abuse cases almost always follow the same script, as you write in your book, why is it so hard to stop them?    So many reasons, but in cases of coercive control, I think it boils 
down to this. Many women donat know they are experiencing abuse until 
they are already in situations that are incredibly dangerous a partly 
because coercive control is so poorly understood, but also because the 
perpetrator makes it invisible. By the time victims realise the danger 
theyare in, many believe no system will ever be powerful enough to keep 
them safe. If they do report to police a if something reportable 
actually occurs a they are making a terrifying gamble. Will they get an 
officer whoas sympathetic and proactive? Will reporting their partner 
make him more dangerous? What if child protection gets involved? What if
 he contests for custody? There are absolutely no guarantees that they 
(or their children) will be protected. Their suspicion that the system 
is not powerful enough to protect them is too often correct. The justice
 system is not only full of holes; too often it actively colludes with 
the perpetrator (especially the family law system). So they stay, even 
after they want to leave, and know itas dangerous. They stay because it 
may be even more dangerous to leave. Until the justice system properly 
assesses  and responds  to risk, and as long as women are made to
 be responsible for their own safety, we will continue to see an 
intractable domestic homicide rate.    How do some men come to feel so entitled to their power over women?    Thousands of years of patriarchy has laid pretty good groundwork for 
this a and itas not so long since a wife was considered her husbandas 
property, and had no legal rights whatsoever. It was only in the 1980s 
that new laws against marital rape recognised that men didnat have the 
right to demand sex with their wives anytime they wanted; prior to that,
 consent was considered to have been given on the wedding day and never 
revoked. Today, we still live in a society that entrenches womenas 
subordination at every level a from the home, to the boardroom, to our 
parliament. Even in the courtroom, as we see so often. As the Harvard 
psychiatrist Judith Herman writes: aThe legal system is designed to 
protect men from the superior power of the state but not to protect 
women or children from the superior power of men.a Iam sure any survivor
 reading this will know exactly what sheas talking about.   Men donat abuse women because society tells them itas OK. Men abuse 
women because society tells them they are entitled to be in control. In 
fact, society says that if they are  not  in control, they wonat 
succeed a they wonat get the girl, they wonat get the money, and they 
will be vulnerable to the violence and control of other men. It says 
that if they fail to assert themselves like areal mena, they will end up
 poor and alone.   But we donat just see men being entitled to power over their 
partners; some women identify with this, too. Thatas because ahaving 
power overa is valued within patriarchy a much more for men than it is 
for women a but nevertheless, it is regarded generally as a sign of 
strength to claim power over others. To add more complication, in many 
perpetrators who have had trauma or attachment disruption in their 
childhoods, you get another layer of entitlement: as one perpetrator 
told me aI never had any control over anything as a child, and I vowed 
that I would never let that happen to me again. I would always be in 
control.a   Trauma-based entitlement is very common in people who are abusive a 
the notion that aI had to go through so much, so fuck you, you just have
 to deal with whatever I do to you.a When that entitlement is thwarted, 
there is this notion of being defied, of being humiliated a of being 
shamed. This is what has been called ahumiliated furya a when 
insecurity, toxic shame and entitlement combine. That is a very 
dangerous emotional state.    Do behaviour change programs for men work?    Opinions a and studies - on this are mixed. Here in Australia, group 
therapeutic programs generally run for a few months, once a week. A  recent study 
 by Monash University found that 65% of men report that they are 
aviolence freea or almost violence free two years after the program 
ended; that is a very encouraging result. There are a couple of 
residential therapeutic programs, like Breathing Space in Western 
Australia and Room4Change in Canberra, that I think are also really 
promising a they give men a place to live, so women and children donat 
have to leave, and they follow up intensive individual and group work 
with months of ongoing outreach support. Indigenous menas programs 
throughout the country are also some of the best Iave seen, in terms of 
reconnecting men to what is meaningful.   But the model I keep coming back to is one that actually takes 
seriously the deep work that is required to shift men out of 
long-habituated behaviour. Itas a Scottish program called the Caledonian
 model, and it runs for two years. It combines two approaches to 
offending that are typically at odds with each other a the 
psychopathology model, which looks at what drives a specific person to 
abuse, and the feminist model, which looks at how men are socialised 
under patriarchy, and how gender inequality underpins their abusive 
behaviour.   To do this it gives abusers six months of one-on-one counselling to 
begin with, and puts them in touch with specialists who can deal with 
any other presenting issues: addiction, mental illness, childhood 
trauma, etc. After that they go into a group program with other men, 
where they confront issues around gendered expectations, socialisation, 
what actually constitutes abuse and so on. Then they go back into 
one-on-one counselling. Throughout that time, caseworkers are also 
working directly with their partners or ex-partners, and their children.
 Itas a fantastic model.    How can you help a friend if you think they are being coercively controlled?    When you first hear those red flags a isolation, micro-management, 
rule-setting, financial control a you need to respond carefully. Listen 
without judgement. Criticise their partneras behaviour, but donat 
condemn their partner a that may only make them defensive. Comment on 
the changes youave notice in them personally, and why youare worried 
about it. Most importantly, donat give up. The perpetrator wants their 
partner to be isolated a donat enable them. Stay in contact, if you can.
 Remember always that your friend is the expert in their own experience,
 and they donat need you to take over. Let them know that if they are 
thinking of leaving, they should get in touch with a domestic violence 
caseworker, so they can develop a safety plan. Lastly, donat make your 
friendship conditional on your friend leaving a they may take months or 
years to leave, or they may never leave. Just let them know you will be 
there for them, no matter what.    The federal government says it is open to new ideas for reducing violence. Can you suggest any?    We need practical action, at the coalface, that encourages a and 
supports a women to seek help, keeps them and their children safe, and 
removes the loopholes of impunity for perpetrators.   If the government wants new ideas, here are some bold new strategies a
 proven to reduce domestic abuse here and internationally a that we 
should be seriously considering.   First, the introduction of police stations for women, which are 
solely dedicated to policing family violence (and provide a one-stop 
shop for women and children, including therapeutic, legal and financial 
help), have been proven to reduce domestic homicide in countries across 
South America, and crucially, they get women reporting earlier. Greens 
co-deputy Larissa Waters is calling for a trial of these womenas police 
stations.   Second we should look very seriously at criminalising coercive 
control, as has been promised by the Queensland opposition leader, Deb 
Frecklington, and urged by New South Wales MP Anna Watson. Criminalising
 coercive control is not just about locking people up. Itas about  changing the paradigm on domestic abuse 
 and requiring police to investigate and report on the entire arc of a 
relationship, instead of isolated incidents. Globally speaking, Scotland
 is seen as the world leader, as all of the harms of domestic abuse are 
included under the one charge.    Third, Iam also a big advocate of localised strategies, like focused 
deterrence and justice reinvestment, that develop close and constant 
collaboration between the community sector a domestic abuse, substance 
abuse, homelessness and so on a and the justice system. These strategies
 break down silos between sector groups that often work at odds with 
each other, they close loopholes in the justice system, and they deliver
 a strong message to perpetrators that unless they accept the help that 
is on offer, and make the rational choice to stop their offending, they 
will feel the full force of the law.   Last, fix the family law system. The Australian Law Reform Commission
 has delivered a set of reforms that will make children safe. Implement 
them.    What could we do today - right now - to urgently improve this situation and prevent more murders like this?    The good news is we know that change is possible.   Here are some critical changes the federal parliament could introduce
 now. To begin with, straightaway announce enough secure funding for the
 womenas refuge sector to ensure no woman or child is denied vital 
protection. Allocate proper funding for affordable and transitional 
housing so they can move into homes they can afford. Reverse funding 
cuts to community legal aid a we just saw $130,000 in funding removed 
from Victoria Legal Aid, which has cancelled the Court Network of 
volunteers who help family violence victims at the family law courts; 
community legal aid is already woefully underfunded. There is so much 
good work already being done a if the federal government truly cared 
about women and childrenas safety, theyad stop making the womenas sector
 beg and scrape for basic funding.    In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by 
sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 
737 732 or visit  1800RESPECT.org.au . In the UK, visit the National Domestic Abuse Helpline website  here  or call  0808 2000 247 . In the US visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline website  here , or call  1-800-799-7233 .   "
1474927953,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/08/im-profoundly-sad-i-feel-guilty-scientists-reveal-personal-fears-about-the-climate-crisis,2020-03-07,"'I'm profoundly sad, I feel guilty': scientists reveal their personal fears about the climate crisis"," In 2014, Joe Duggan started reaching out to climate scientists to ask them a question: how did climate change make them feel?   aI was just blown away when I started getting the letters back,a he says.   Duggan, a science communicator at Australian National University, set
 up a website and starting publishing the mostly handwritten responses.   a[Professor] Katrin Meissner was one of the first, and her letter really hit me. It was so ... unscience-y. Almost poetic.a   aIt makes me feel sad. And it scares me,a Meissner wrote.   aIt scares me more than anything else. I see a group of people 
sitting in a boat, happily waving, taking pictures on the way, not 
knowing that this boat is floating right into a powerful and deadly 
waterfall.a   In the end, more than 40 scientists responded a many leaders in their
 field. Some wrote neatly on lined notepaper, others scrawled on the 
back of student papers they were marking.   aIt became a big part of my life,a Duggan says. aI felt a little bit 
out of my depth. It took its toll on me and in the end I felt I had to 
step away. I went into my shell and pretty much turned off my phone for 
three years.   aBut Iave got some emotional resilience back now. My partner and I 
found out weare pregnant a due in August. I donat want that kid to grow 
up asking why we didnat actually do anything.a   So Duggan has returned to his apassion projecta a  Is This How You Feel  a by asking the scientists to write again. Have their feelings changed in the intervening years?   The first 10 return letters are emotional outpourings of despair, 
hope, fear and determination in the age of the climate crisis, from the 
people helping the world understand its impacts while also being mums, 
dads and grandparents.   Since the first letters were written, two Australian correspondents  Tony McMichael  and  Michael Raupach  have died. But Duggan is trying to reach their family members to see if they can keep the legacy moving.   Meissner, now director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the 
University of New South Wales, didnat hesitate to respond partly because
 ait was the right thing to doa.   aBut also because we have not been very good at communicating climate
 science to the public and I believe that it is my duty as a citizen to 
alert people to the urgency of the situation.a   But does Meissner think thereas a risk in scientists lifting their 
veil of cool objectivity to show their personal feelings? Could it cause
 some to question their objectivity?   aI actually think that the opposite is the case,a she says. aWhen I 
saw the whole collection of letters a few years ago, I was surprised by 
the number of colleagues who had participated.   aWe are talking here about world-leading scientists, people who built
 their career on facts and data, who are spending their lives 
questioning every result they find, over and over again. People who are 
continuously challenging the status quo. People who are trained to be 
objective.   aWhen these people start to speak up about their feelings, about 
being frustrated, desperate, worried, angry or scared, then we really 
should listen very carefully.a   Duggan wants anyone who has read the letters to write their own, and 
share them. Here are some excerpts from the latest scientist letters 
from Dugganas project.   How do I feel about it? I am still very worried. I am also profoundly sad. I am probably sadder than I was five years ago.   I feel powerless and, to a certain extent, guilty. I feel like I
 have failed my duty as a citizen and as a mother because I was not able
 to communicate the urgency of the situation well enough to trigger 
meaningful action in time.   What we are doing right now is an uncontrolled, risky experiment with the planet we live on.   Iam angry because the lack of effective action on climate change, 
despite the wealth not only of scientific information but also of 
solutions to reduce emissions, has now created a climate emergency.   The students are right. Their future is now being threatening by the 
greed of the wealthy fossil fuel elite, the lies of the Murdoch press, 
and the weakness of our political leaders. These people have no right to
 destroy my daughteras future and that of her generation.   My emotions havenat really changed since I last wrote one of these 
letters, but things around me have. The beacon of light that is Greta 
Thunberg, speaking truth to power. Our own wonderful, passionate school 
kids taking to the streets, making me cry with pride.  The only way 
to cope with all of this is to focus on what I can do, what Iam best at,
 and hope like hell that enough people, doing what they do best, can 
overcome.   I have some very dark moments, but more than ever before, I feel 
wrapped in a blanket of collective determination. Hope is a necessary 
emotion, but more than that, it must be our fundamental strategy to keep
 us going. Lose it, and we are lost.   For the most part my comments of 19 September 2014 still apply except
 that the glimmer of hope has diminished if not vanished entirely. With 
Obama as US president and the Paris agreement in late 2015, a glimmer of
 hope seemed to emerge, but with Trump and his ignorant accomplices, the
 hope has vanished.   I am close to retirement and as I was cleaning up in 2019 I found 
some old VHS tapes recording me on shows, such as the Lehrer News Hour 
on PBS in 1988, and the message then was much the same as now except we 
are now more confident and the progress has been nil. It was depressing.
 My solution has been to move back to New Zealand along with my daughter
 and family (grandchildren).   Realistically, we are already too late to meet a 1.5 degree target and will struggle to achieve 2 degrees.   So, the future, basically, looks bad. Hard to stay hopeful. Change is too slow, too late.   Yet we have to stay optimistic.   Dear Joe, a Climate Change feels very real and I think this 
summer we reached a tipping point in Australia. As I write this my 
husband, a bushfire fighter, is battling a fire in Canberra and Iam 
working from home as a freak hailstorm destroyed my car three days ago. 
In four days, weave been smashed by our climate: hail, extreme winds, 
toxic smoke and fire.   a|. So how do I feel? Frustrated, angry that our science is ignored by
 politicians, scared for my husband and all the others who are on the 
frontline fighting these fires and trying to help.   But mostly I feel devastated for my son, and his generation, who will
 have to heal this planet and live with the mass environmental 
destruction we have caused.   I feel scared for the future when faced with simple downright ignorance from some political leaders.   I
 feel tired, tired that in spite of bushfires, floods etc I still seem 
to be banging my head against a brick wall to convince people that the 
threat of climate change is severe.   I feel relieved that now I am retired I donat have to live and breathe this every minute of every day.   I feel guilty that I am stepping back from the frontline, so even though I am retired I feel compelled to carry on working.   I
 feel unspeakable joy at the news that I am to become a grandfather for 
the first time, but fearful of the world my grandchild will grow up in.   I feel relieved that when my grandchild grows up and asks me why
 we did nothing to stop climate change I can at least say that I did my 
best.   As I sit writing this on a bench looking out over the moors I
 feel uplifted that despite everything the world is still the most 
beautiful place.   The full collection of letters is available at  Is This How You Feel .  "

   From astronaut Anousheh Ansari to 
politician JA3hanna SigurAdegardA3ttir, here's a look at some of the most 
remarkable women who made history with their outstanding achievements in
 their respective fields.   With 289 consecutive days in space, 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut made 
history on Dec. 28, 2019, by surpassing Peggy Whitsonas record for the 
longest spaceflight in a single mission by a woman. By the time Koch 
returned to Earth in February 2020, she had spent 328 days in space a 
the second highest in a single mission by an American astronaut. With 
fellow astronaut Jessica Meir, Koch set another milestone during the 
mission a the first all-female spacewalk (pictured, R).   At the Stuttgart World Championships 
held in October 2019, Biles became the first gymnast to win five gold 
medals at a single world championship since 1958. The medal haul, which 
brought her world medal total to 25, also helped her break Belarusian 
Vitaly Scherboas career total of 23 to become the worldas most decorated
 gymnast.   Thomas, an American football 
official, made history as the first female referee to officiate a 
National Football League (NFL) playoff game on Jan. 13, 2019 (pictured).
 Before the remarkable first, Thomas had already created history as the 
first woman to referee a major college football game in 2007. Two years 
later, she became the first woman to officiate in a bowl game and in 
2011 was the first woman to officiate in a Big Ten stadium as a line 
judge. In 2015, she was hired as the first full-time female referee in 
NFL history.   An ethnic Yazidi from Iraq, Murad 
shared the Nobel Prize for Peace with Congolese gynecologist Denis 
Mukwege in 2018 for their ""efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a
 weapon of war and armed conflict."" She was kept as a captive by the 
Islamic State (ISIS) who attacked her village when she was 19. In 2015, 
Murad managed to take refuge in Germany, where she works as an activist 
helping women and children who are victims of abuse and human 
trafficking.   The civil rights activist founded the
 ""Me Too"" movement in 2006 to raise awareness about sexual abuse and to 
build solidarity among survivors of sexual harassment. The use of #MeToo
 as a hashtag became a global phenomenon in 2017 in the wake of 
allegations of sexual abuse against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
 Today, the hashtag is used across the world to highlight cases of 
sexual harassment or assault. In 2017, Time magazine included Burke 
among ""The Silence Breakers,"" a group of women it named as its 2017 
Person of the Year.   On April 24, 2017, Whitson, the first
 woman to have commanded the International Space Station (ISS) twice, 
broke the record for the most cumulative days spent in space by any NASA
 astronaut by clocking more than 534 days. By September that year, she 
accumulated a total of 665 days over the course of her career a the most
 by any woman worldwide. Whitson also set other records a the oldest 
female astronaut at age 57 and woman astronaut with most spacewalks 
(10). She retired from NASA on June 15, 2018.   She made history as the first female 
coach to lead a menas soccer team (Eastern Sports Club) to a 
professional top-flight league championship victory in May 2016. For the
 feat, Chan, who was 27 years old at the time, was named among the top 
women of the year by the BBC and received the Asian Football 
Confederation (AFC) Womenas Coach of the Year award. Her achievement was
 also recognized by Guinness World Records.   Payne became the first-ever female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup in the horse raceas 155 years of history on Nov. 3, 2015.   One of the leading figures of the 
French New Wave film movement, Varda (1928-2019) became the first woman 
to receive an honorary Palme d'or in May 2015. The prize is given to 
directors whose works have had a global impact. Varda's work on social 
issues and feminist topics, and her unconventional methods in film 
direction brought about a fresh trend in the world of arts.   In 2014, Yousafzai became the 
youngest Nobel laureate at the age of 17 when she was jointly awarded 
the Nobel Peace prize with Indiaas Kailash Satyarthi afor their struggle
 against the suppression of children and young people and for the right 
of all children to education."" The Pakistani activist grabbed the 
worldas attention when she was shot in the head in 2012 by the Taliban 
for advocating girlas education in her native Swat Valley. Yousafzai is 
today counted among the most powerful voices for the rights of children.   Diacre became the first woman to lead
 a men's professional soccer team (Clermont Foot 63) in a major European
 country (France) on Aug. 4, 2014. Three years later, she was appointed 
as the manager of Franceas womenas national team a a position she 
currently holds.   One of the most accomplished women in
 auto racing, Patrick created history when she became the first woman to
 clinch pole position for the Daytona 500 a NASCAR's highest division a 
on Feb. 17, 2013. In the subsequent race, she finished eighth a the 
best-ever finish by a woman at the event. In 2015, Patrick beat Janet 
Guthrie's record for the most top-ten finishes (six) by a woman in the 
Sprint Cup Series. She retired from the sport in 2018.   In 2013, McFadden became the first 
female athlete to win six gold medals at the 2013 IPC Athletics World 
Championships in Lyon, France. She claimed gold in every category: from 
the 100m meters through to the 5,000 meters events. Winning the Boston, 
Chicago, London and New York marathons in 2013, she became the first 
person to win all four World Major Marathons in the same year. McFadden 
won four gold medals at the Rio Paralympic Games in 2016, which brought 
her total Paralympic gold medal count to seven.    On Sept. 2, 2013, after breaking 
several swimming records and gaining major attention for swimming across
 large distances, the American author and swimmer became the first woman
 to swim from Cuba to Florida, U.S., a distance of 110 miles (177 
kilometers), without the aid of a protective cage. She was 64 at the 
time.   In May 2012, Napravnik became the 
first woman jockey to win the U.S. Kentucky Oaks. She won the same race 
again in 2014. She also won the Breedersa Cup twice a in 2012 and 2014. 
Napravnik was seven weeks pregnant when she won the championship the 
second time.   Bigelow created history by becoming 
the first woman to bag an Oscar for Best Director in 2010 for the movie 
aThe Hurt Lockera (2009). She was also the first woman to be awarded by 
the Directors Guild of America in its 62-year history for the same 
movie. Bigelow's other hits include aStrange Daysa (1995), aK-19: The 
Widowmakera (2002) and aZero Dark Thirtya (2012).   On Feb. 1, 2009, she became the first
 female prime minister of Iceland and the world's first openly gay head 
of government. Advocating gay-rights and gender equality, SigurAdegardA3ttir
 set an example by marrying her partner on June 27, 2010 a the day 
same-sex marriages were legalized in her country.   On Sept. 18, 2006, the 
Iranian-American businesswoman became the first female space tourist 
when a Soyuz space capsule took off with her and two astronauts for the 
International Space Station from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome. She 
was also the first self-funded woman to fly to space. Ansari talked 
about her experiences in her memoir aMy Dream of Stars: From Daughter of
 Iran to Space Pioneer,a published in 2010. In 2018, she became the CEO 
of XPRIZE, a nonprofit organization.   The first woman judge in Iran, Ebadi 
was honored with the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2003 afor her efforts for 
democracy and human rights.a The Nobel citation also states that she 
ahas focused especially on the struggle for the rights of women and 
children."" Forced to work as a clerk in following the 1979 Islamic 
Revolution, Ebadi took early retirement in protest. It was not until 
1992 that she was able to obtain a lawyeras license and set up private 
practice, which enabled her to represent and fight for the rights of 
women and children.   Taymor received the Tony Award for 
Outstanding Direction of a Musical for aThe Lion Kinga in 1998, making 
her the first woman to win the honor. The second award she won for the 
production was Outstanding Costume Design. Apart from helming Broadway 
hits such as aThe Green Birda (2000) and aSpider-Man: Turn Off The Darka
 (2011), Taymor directed acclaimed films such as aFridaa (2002) and 
aAcross the Universea (2007).   The U.S. astronaut became the first 
woman to pilot a space mission, serving as second-in-command for 
Discovery, in 1995. She was given the command of space shuttle Columbia 
in 1999, making her the first female shuttle commander.   Franklin (1942-2018) was the first 
woman performer to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 
1987, when she was 45. A winner of 18 Grammy Awards, she was ranked 
number one by Rolling Stone magazine on its 100 Greatest Singers of All 
Time in 2010.   With her July 1984 mission, Soviet 
cosmonaut Savitskaya became not only the first woman to have gone to 
space twice but also the first woman to perform a spacewalk (pictured, 
R). During the mission, she spent three hours and 35 minutes outside the
 Salyut 7 space station cutting and welding metals a a feat that made 
her first person to weld in space.   On May 16, 1975, more than 20 years 
after the Mount Everest was first scaled, Tabei (1939-2016) became the 
first woman mountaineer to reach the summit (pictured, R). The Japanese 
mountaineer continued scaling peaks, and in June 1992 became the first 
woman to scale the Seven Summits, the highest mountains of each 
continent.   The Welsh novelistas (1923-2004) 
fourth book, aThe Elected Membera (1969) made her the first woman to win
 the Man Booker Prize in 1970. Her other notable works include aBirds of
 Passagea (1981) aKingdom Comea (1990), aA Solitary Griefa (1991) and 
aThe Waiting Gamea (1997). Some of Ruben's books, such as aMadame 
Sousatzkaa (1962), have been adapted for films and TV series.   Geraldine ""Jerrie"" Mock (1925-2014) 
became the first woman to fly solo around the world on April 17, 1964, 
covering a distance of 23,103 miles (37,180 kilometers) in 29 days 11 
hours and 59 minutes. For her accomplishment, the American was awarded 
the Louis BlA(c)riot silver medal from the FA(c)dA(c)ration AA(c)ronautique 
Internationale a the first American and first woman to be so honored a 
and Federal Aviation Administration's Exception Service Decoration by 
the then-U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. She published her 
story in the book aThree-Eight Charlie,a released in 1970.   Tereshkova was selected from among a 
group of four trained women to pilot the Vostok 6 in June 1963, making 
her the first woman to have reached space. Following her successful 
mission during which she orbited Earth 48 times in three days, 
Tereshkova started an active political life and represented the Soviet 
Union at international events.   Colonel Cochran (1906-80) of the U.S.
 became the first woman to fly at supersonic speeds in 1953. She was 
also the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic. At the time of
 her death, she held the records for the maximum speed, distance and 
altitude in the history of aviation.   Dinsdale (1926-99) was present at the
 first Emmy presentation ceremony to receive the first ever award for 
Outstanding Television Personality. The ventriloquist broke into radio 
with aJudy Splinters,a her dummy, which also got her a childrenas TV 
show after she won the award.   The renowned Danish actress 
(1889-1964) debuted as a director with aAfsporeta in 1942 and made nine 
more films in the next nine years. She went on to win four Bodil awards,
 which were named after her and fellow actress Bodil Kjer.   Earhart (1897-1939, pictured, R) was a
 pioneer in the field of aviation and became the first woman to fly 
across the Atlantic Ocean as a passenger in 1928 and solo in 1932. She 
was instrumental in the formation of the Ninety-Nines, an international 
organization for female pilots, of which she was the first president. 
Earhart, along with Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean 
during a circumnavigation attempt in 1937. She was officially declared 
dead two years later.    The American competition swimmer 
(1905-2003) was the first woman to swim across the English Channel, a 
task she accomplished on Aug. 6, 1926. In her later years, Ederle, who 
had a hearing problem since childhood, became a swimming instructor for 
deaf children.   The Canadian-American explorer 
(1906-96) is regarded as the first woman to drive around the world a a 
feat she started working on when she was 16 a as certified by the 
Guinness World Records. Driving a Ford Model-T, she began from Nice, 
France, in December 1922 and reached back in January 1927.   Marvingt (1875-1963; pictured, R) 
became the first woman to fly combat missions when she decided to become
 a bomber pilot for France during World War I. Awarded the Croix de 
Guerre, she was also instrumental in the introduction of air ambulance 
services.   Quimby (1875-1912) managed to change 
the scenario for women in aviation and, in 1911, became the first 
American woman to get a pilotas license. The next year, she became the 
first female pilot to fly solo across the English Channel. Quimby was 
killed in an air crash in 1912.   The French aviatrix (1882-1919) 
became the worldas first woman to receive an airplane pilotas license in
 1910. Despite suffering severe injuries during an air show, she 
continued with flying and won a cup for flying nonstop for four hours. 
She died in a plane crash in 1919.   Curie's (1867-1934) discovery of 
radium and polonium led to her becoming the first woman to win the Nobel
 Prize (in Physics) in 1903. In 1911, she became the first person and 
the only woman to win the prize twice when she was awarded for 
Chemistry. Her work on radioactivity shaped much of the scientific 
developments in the 20th and 21st centuries.    38/38 SLIDES 
    STOPPING THE VIOLENCE    Living standards in Asia
 and the Pacific have improved dramatically in the past years, with the 
region contributing two thirds of global growth, according to a recent 
report by the United Nations. aYet many people a and women especially a 
remain left behind, caught in a net of inequalities that prevent them 
from reaping the benefits of this growth,a it said.   aProgress 
towards gender parity in education has not translated into equal rights 
for women to labour markets, while violence against women remains 
widespread across the region.a   A poll of global experts in 2018 named India as the worldas most 
dangerous country for women due to the high risk of sexual violence and 
being forced into slave labour. War-torn Afghanistan and Syria came 
second and third in the Thomson Reuters Foundation study, followed by 
Somalia and Saudi Arabia.   But achange is certainly afoota, 
according to Puja Kapai, an associate professor of law at the University
 of Hong Kong, who wrote about the evolution of the #MeToo movement in 
Asia in the  Asian Jurist  last year.   Around Asia, in 
countries such as China, South Korea, Japan and India, the #MeToo 
movement against the harassment of women was aclearly building on 
decades of feminist organisation and activism to challenge the 
widespread perpetration and tolerance of sexual violence as a privilege 
of the elite, powerful and well-connecteda, the scholar wrote.   Student leader Thakur rarely leaves the house without taking various 
precautions. aWhen we go out we wonat wear certain things, we have 
pepper spray in our bag, we have emergency contacts in our phones, and 
we often share live locations with each other,a says Thakur, referring 
to how she and her friends protect each other.   aWe also often restrict ourselves from going alone to some places.a   Almost
 every one of her friends has experienced sexual harassment. 
aPreviously, people would not discuss this. I see the change coming. We 
now come across rape cases each and every day a people are more 
educated, they are realising this is a serious issue.a   Yet, there 
is a long way to go, she says. Thakur and many of her friends are 
frustrated by how slow the justice system works in cases of sexual 
violence.   Court cases can drag on for many years and suspects are often granted bail.   aThese things should be faster and proper punishment should be implemented,a she says. aPeople would fear it more.a   Thakur hopes more parents will encourage their daughters to take 
self-defence classes and to discuss their problems openly, while 
allowing them more freedom to go out and protest.   In recent months, women have been at the forefront of several anti-government protests in places such as India and Hong Kong.   Despite some cultural shifts, Thakur still fears for her future as a woman.   After graduating this May, she intends to apply for a masteras degree in business administration and then pursue a PhD.   Thakur
 is aware she will be pressured into getting married by the end of her 
studies. aPeople expect a lot out of a woman. My future will depend on 
the kind of people I will be surrounded with, if I can go abroad or 
outside my city. It will depend on the kind of husband I will have. I am
 scared as hell because of those things.a    MARRIAGE EXPECTATIONS    In
 Vietnam, Tra My Tran, 30, is feeling the pressure to get married and 
give birth. While her mother supported her in pursuing her education and
 professional dreams a even when that was frowned upon by neighbours who
 thought she should find a husband instead a she began feeling pressure 
from her family last year.   aIn the last months of 2019, my mum kept asking me and telling me 
about the importance of a relationship and getting married,a says Tran, 
who coordinates the psychology department at the non-profit Blue Dragon 
Childrenas Foundation.   Tran says she plans to get married but not just yet, despite warnings anot to leave it too latea.   She says many like her are trapped by high expectations. aWe need to be the perfect woman, the perfect role model in all areas.a   Pan
 Wang, senior lecturer in Chinese and Asian Studies at the University of
 New South Wales, Australia, says that in Chinaas urban areas amany 
women have become so-called aleftover womena because they can hardly 
find a compatible marriage partner due to their age, with most in their 
30s, high educational attainment and economic independencea.   aThis situation is worsened when men look to amarry downa and women amarry upa,a says Wang.    TURNING POINT    Tran,
 who lives in Hanoi, Vietnamas capital, says those surrounding her are 
increasingly aware of womenas rights. aI can see we are at a turning 
point. There is a behaviour change in my generation. More men are now 
willing to do house work and share child-caring responsibilities.a   But
 Tran says there continues to be discrimination against women in the 
workplace, with some fearing they will lose their job if they take 
maternity leave.   She says the way women are perceived and their 
access to opportunities remain unequal in parts of the country. aThere 
is still this perception that the wife is the one taking orders. Many 
become victims of violence. And women often blame themselves for not 
meeting the expectations of their fathers, boyfriends, husbands,a says 
Tran, who works with human-trafficking survivors.   aAnother issue 
among many ethnic minorities is that the right of education for girls is
 still not upheld and we see many early marriages. They are the most 
vulnerable,a says Tran, who has come across women pushed into marriages 
when they were 13 years old.   Wang, the researcher, says feminist movements struggle to reach rural parts of neighbouring China.   aItas
 difficult for large numbers of illiterate women in rural China to 
disclose sexual misconduct by men. One reason is that many do not see 
this as a problem. The other is that some are too afraid to speak out 
and donat know how to speak out.a   Although Chinaas #MeToo campaign
 is growing, Wang says, ait is not quite a movement yet as itas limited 
in scale and has to be carried out in hidden forms, for example, using 
coded messages and homophone hashtags such as #ricebunny [spoken in 
Chinese as mi tu] to circumvent government censorshipa.    MENSTRUATION RIGHTS    The urban-rural dichotomy is felt elsewhere, too, including in Nepal, the home of Sharmila Dhungana, 25.   She
 was born in the western part of the country in a buffalo shed. Things 
have improved since then, but some people living in rural areas continue
 to uphold superstitions and cultural norms that dictate the place of 
women in society.   When Dhungana, a climate change researcher for an intergovernmental 
centre in Asia, began menstruating, she tried to keep it to herself. But
 her mother eventually found out. aI was in this isolated room for like 
13 days,a she recalls. aI was told then that I should not look at my 
brother or father, only after taking a bath a because itas purifying. 
Shouldnat touch the plants or sit on the sofa.a   Dhungana, who now 
lives in Nepalas capital Kathmandu, has since graduated in public health
 from the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh and has travelled to 
other countries.   She realises how deeply rooted the traditions 
around menstruation are in some parts of Nepal. aI am still supposed to 
wear a separate set of clothes and not enter the kitchen. But now I 
often say that I just forgot,a she says, explaining that one of her ways
 is to push for change within her own family every time she visits them.
 aI also have open conversations about it with my siblings [a younger 
sister and brother] and cousins,a she says.   aIf I have a daughter,
 I will never put her through this. This will stop,a says Dhungana, who 
has led workshops teaching village children about menstruation.   In
 recent years, the government has taken measures to uproot the 
amenstruation hutsa where women are required to sleep during their 
periods in some western parts of the country.   Some have died due 
to the dire conditions in the huts. But despite the authoritiesa 
attempts, many residents are resisting the change.   Dhungana, who 
has taken part in several female-led initiatives, says that feminism is 
rising in Nepal. aBut talking and doing is a different thing,a she says.
 aThe society has been structured patriarchally and there is still this 
sense of entitlement [among men].a   She says the conversation needs to be broader and include people of different regions, casts and social backgrounds.   Dhungana
 was brought up with the idea that a womanas role is to care for others.
 aThe ambitions of my motheras generation were building a house, giving 
education to their children. But I never saw my mum having individual 
dreams.a   Dhungana a who won a solo travel challenge for women in 
Nepal a says although she grapples with social expectations, she wonat 
give up on carving dreams of her own. aThis is why I find financial 
independence and learning about myself so important. Travelling is, for 
me, a way to understand the world and myself.a    CONCEPTS OF MOTHERHOOD    In
 Hong Kong, Circle Yuen, 35, hopes that when her two young daughters, 
aged two and nine, reach adulthood they will encounter less prejudice in
 society.   aI hope they get to be true to themselves. It may sound easy, but itas so hard.a   Yuen,
 born and raised in the city, knows what she is talking about. She and 
her former partner broke up when their daughter was only two. After a 
series of heated arguments, Yuen realised they could not live together, 
but she did not know what to do next.   aWhen I faced this problem, 
it was so hard to seek help and talk to people. Very luckily I walked 
into a bookstore and saw a co-parenting communication handbook. I did 
not know what that was,a she recalls.   Yuen, who eventually got 
separated, says pressure from society made her personal struggle even 
harder. aMy daughter was living in our house with her dad, and my 
grandmother kept asking why I had left my daughter. At the time, I 
thought I had to take the blame. I believed I was not as good a mother 
as they were,a Yuen recalls.   She has found more healthy ways to 
communicate with her former partner. aI am still learning,a she says. 
aBut I can say that I walked through the marriage storm and got more 
confident.a   On the way, she has grown as a community leader while being a wife 
and a mother, says Yuen, who was a fellow with Hong Kong-based 
non-profit Resolve.   aThey got me a mentor who shared an important thought with me: we may see our story as shame, but others see it as courage.a   Yuen,
 who has had a second daughter with her current partner, now dedicates 
most of her time to an independent project about co-parenting, which has
 included producing books, community theatre and educational programmes.   Although
 divorce rates have gone up, she says athere is still a lot of invisible
 pressure deeply rooted in Chinese and other Asian culturesa.   Yuen,
 who previously worked for an advocacy group against sexual violence, 
says gender inequality has led to suffering among both women and men. 
aBut perhaps women go through more self-blaming because of the 
traditional ways of perceiving motherhood,a she says. aMany female 
survivors of domestic violence also have a harder time to deal with 
their partners and to find a solution for their relationship.a   She
 says athe concept of a broken family needs to be rewritten. It should 
be seen as a reformed family or a restructured familya.    LESBIAN AND MIGRANT    Jhic Dacio, from the Philippines, agrees that traditional concepts of family and gender need to be scrapped.   She
 has lived in Hong Kong since 2002 as a domestic worker and is the sole 
breadwinner of her family. Dacio, 45, says she has felt several forms of
 discrimination in the city. aI have gone through some uncomfortable 
situations in the streets here, especially when I am holding hands with 
my partner. Some people stare at us,a says Dacio, a lesbian.   She 
has also experienced discrimination within the community of domestic 
workers in the city, who are mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia. 
aSome people make nasty comments, things like aa lesbian canat give a 
good family or a babya,a she says.   Her sexual preferences are not the only reason she has felt excluded 
at times. aRacism is still around,a she says. On top of that, domestic 
workers a largely under-represented in recent feminist movements a also 
face systemic forms of discrimination that stem, in Dacioas opinion, 
from insufficient protection provided by the government.   Marie 
Segrave, an associate professor in criminology at Monash University, 
says across Asia low-skilled female migrants tend to have limited 
options ato secure their own safety and to bring to the fore experiences
 of abuse or exploitation running from the context of intimate partner 
relationships to the workplacea.   In Singapore, female migrant 
domestic workers are among the groups most vulnerable to gender-based 
violence and discrimination, along with family caregivers, single 
mothers and foreign spouses and children, says Shailey Hingorani, head 
of research and advocacy for the non-profit Aware.   The researcher 
says that although Singaporean women receive the same opportunities as 
men in education and when entering the workforce, atraditional gender 
rolesa still determine who aperforms unpaid domestic or caregiving 
worka.   For instance, the workforce participation drops sharply for
 women once they hit their 30s, which is when many have children. In 
2018, women in Singapore earned 16.3 per cent less than men when 
comparing the median pay between both genders. These are among the 
factors, Hingorani says, that aresult in many women in Singapore ageing 
into povertya.   According to Aware, sexual violence cases involving
 technology a such as cyber harassment, voyeurism and non-consensual 
distribution of intimate images a almost tripled from 2016, when 46 were
 reported, to 124 in 2018.    OUT LOUD    The 
2020 Asia Girls Report and Girlsa Leadership Index a which analysed 19 
countries on aspects such as education and political voice a put 
Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam in the top three positions.   aThere
 is still no country in the world where girls and women are equal to 
boys and men. Asian countries are no exception. But we have the 
resources and expertise to do better, we just need to make it a 
priority,a says Bhagyashri Dengle, regional director of the charity Plan
 International Asia-Pacific.   Sara Davies, an Australia-based 
international relations professor focused on women, peace and security, 
says the increased rates of female participation in formal employment 
are expected to bring amassive shiftsa to employment relations, 
discrimination laws and wages in Asia. aThis will not happen overnight 
but it is happening. As more women enter the formal workforce, societies
 cannot continue to accept or tolerate violence against women for 
travelling at night, for what they wear, etc,a she says.   Dacio, 
who set up Share Hong Kong a a group that organises activities for 
migrants a says women in both developed and developing nations need to 
fight sexism.   aThe sending-away culture of my country is not fair 
for women,a she says, referring to the thousands of female migrants who 
work abroad and live apart from their families to send money back to the
 Philippines.   aThen, in their workplaces, many are sexually 
harassed and even raped,a the domestic worker says. aAnd the problem in 
cities like Hong Kong is that victims are silent because they have 
limited access to an assistance network.a   Despite all the challenges, Dacio has no doubts that women are the backbone of Asia: aWe need to keep speaking up.a

Photographer: Cristobal Olivares/Bloomberg   Photographer: Cristobal Olivares/Bloomberg     Follow Bloomberg on    Telegram  for all the investment news and analysis you need.     A
 new filtration technique could cut the time needed to produce lithium 
raw materials at South Americaas vast evaporation ponds to hours from 
months, according to a study by a group of international scientists.   The method, developed by researchers at Australiaas national 
science institute CSIRO, Monash University, the University of Melbourne 
and the University of Texas at Austin, mimics the filtering capabilities
 of living cells to extract lithium from concentrated salt water, where 
the metal is typically mixed with other materials, including potassium 
and salt.   aWe could one day have the capability to produce simple 
filters that will take hours to extract lithium from brine, rather than 
several months to years,a said Huanting Wang, a professor of chemical 
engineering at Monash University, and among the authors of newly 
published research on the technique.   Early studies indicate about 
90% of contained lithium can be recovered using the filter system, 
compared to about 30% when producers use the existing process of pumping
 brines into a series of ponds and allowing the sun to evaporate the 
liquid for as long as 18 months, according to the researchers. Fort 
Lauderdale-based Energy Exploration Technologies Inc., which is seeking 
to commercialize the technology, says the process can also   cut refining costs  by about half.       Lithium,
 key for rechargebale batteries that power electric cars, is currently 
mainly produced either by refining spodumene, a mineral typically 
extracted from hard rock mines in Australia, or by processing salty 
brines found predominantly in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia.   Though lithium prices have tumbled since mid-2018 as a raft 
of new mine projects have lifted supply and amid weaker demand in China,
 suppliers are focused on developing more efficient production 
techniques ahead of a forecast demand revival from about 2023, according
 to BloombergNEF. Thereas currently not enough lithium capacity under 
development to meet a forecast 2 million tons of total demand by 2030, 
BNEF said in a note last month.      Read more: Bill Gates-Led Fund Invests in Lithium Mining Startup    New extraction technologies promise to curb the use of water 
and energy in lithium production, and to potentially open up new sources

 we have a vaccine, or forms of treatment, to lessen the impact,' she 
said.    The
 Prime Minister is pleading with Australia's biggest companies to avoid 
retrenching their workers as coronavirus hammers the economy.   Scott Morrison asked bosses: 'Hold on to your people.'   He
 also said coronavirus could be worse than the Global Financial Crisis 
of more than a decade ago, with Australia now even more reliant on China
 for exports.   'The Global Financial Crisis was centred in the 
north Atlantic... this crisis is much closer to home,' he told The 
Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney on Tuesday.   Mr
 Morrison begged employers to be kind to their staff as his government 
prepared to unveil a $10billion economic stimulus package that is set to
 include one-off payments to pensioners and Newstart unemployment 
recipients.   Small business operators are also set to receive sweeteners to keep staff employed during these uncertain times.   The
 measures will be designed to ward off an economic downturn with 
memories still fresh of the GFC, which saw 223,900 Australians lose 
their jobs between 2008 and 2014.     Dr Hull also recalled when she immediately went into isolation  seven days after she'd last seen her sick colleague.      Aged
 in her 60s, she was particularly concerned as she's asthmatic and 
allergic to medications that may be needed for secondary infections.    'Those
 who had shared that shift were quarantined. Because we were very busy 
and working in separate spaces that evening, I did not have much 
exposure to our sick doctor. But how much is enough?,' Dr Hull wrote.   'Isolation
 after exposure is scary because there is time to consider the risks. 
That leads to worrying days of information gathering, sharing and 
overload, pondering any slight change in our bodies and enduring long 
anxious nights.'   'We worry about our families, our friends and our
 future, our sick doctor, our hospital colleagues, our responsibilities,
 and our community. '    Dr Hull's article has been forwarded to premier Gladys Berejiklian.   Dr
 Cathie Hull was working at Ryde Hospital (pictured) when she came in

 warning comes after seven new cases were confirmed in New South Wales 
on Monday to take the total number to 47 across the state and 92 
nationwide.   They include two year 10 students from St Patrick's Marist College in Dundas in Sydney's north west.   Both of their fathers  aged in their 50s have also tested positive.    All three schools are just 15 minutes from Macquarie Park, which was dubbed Australia's 'ground zero' for the deadly disease   A

Shore, along with the girl's mother, forcing the closure of the school 
on Tuesday.    A woman aged in her 30s who recently returned from the Philippines was the seventh case confirmed on Monday.        'The vast majority of new cases can be traced to existing cases,' NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said.     'This
 is reassuring as it means we are tracking how COVID-19 has been 
transmitted and in general we are not seeing random cases occur in the 
community at large.'    Both schools are just 15 minutes from 
Macquarie Park, which was dubbed Australia's 'ground zero' after 
locality and surrounding suburbs recorded two of the nation's three 
deaths and at least 13 of the 43 confirmed cases in New South Wales.    Epping Boys High School reopened on Monday four days after a student tested positive.   "

 deadly outbreak of COVID-19, which has infected 100 people across the 
country, has raised questions about leave entitlements for those who 
need to go into isolation for an extended period of 
time.      Employment lawyer at the law firm Maurice 
Blackburn, Giri Sivaraman, said entitlement depends on whether an 
individual is actually sick or just required to undergo testing.   Workers
 who have been told to stay home from work and quarantine themselves 
amid fears they may have been exposed to the virus should be paid as 
usual, he told Daily Mail Australia.      Workers 
who have been told to stay home from work and quarantine themselves amid
 fears they may have been exposed to the virus should be paid as usual, 
an employment expert revealed   The deadly outbreak of 
COVID-19, has raised questions about leave entitlements for those who 
need to go into isolation for an extended period of time (stock 
image)    Australia has now recorded 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including three deaths   'If
 I'm not sick and my employer says to me ""I'm taking precautions in the 
workplace and I'd like you to go home and isolate for a period of time 
and get tested"", then I'm really just being suspended from work and I 
should just continue to get paid normally, I shouldn't have to take any 
leave for that.   'If
 I'm sick and I've got accrued paid sick leave, I'm completely entitled 
to take that. There's no way an employer can tell me don't take your 
paid sick leave.'    Mr Sivaraman said paid sick leave entitlements for coronavirus should apply as it would for any other illness.    However,
 if employees are too unwell to work and do not have any accrued paid 
sick leave left, they may be forced to take unpaid leave or use their 
vacation days.    'If you have no more accrued, you can only be
 on unpaid sick leave for that. It's not your employer's obligation to 
pay you [in that circumstance],' he added.    'If you got other paid leave accrued you can definitely seek to take all of that.'     Otherwise,
 employers cannot force workers to take their annual leave if they are 
not sick and need to be quarantined, without their consent.    Meanwhile,
 NSW Health has informed its workers they will have access to 
special paid leave in addition to their regular entitlements if they are
 required to undergo isolation amid the health crisis.    However,
 workers can end up forfeiting those incentives if they decide to flout 
travel bans and visit countries where the risk of exposure is 
high.    For those cases, they would be required to take annual leave instead, The ABC reported.   But  Coleman Greig employment lawyer Lisa Qiu told the publication leave arrangements in these circumstances differ for  high-risk workplaces.    'The
 standard is going to be different, it's going to be a lot higher in 
terms of the precautions the employer or government is taking,' she 
said.    As fears grow for a coronavirus pandemic, businesses 
have been enacting emergency plans in order to allow work to continue 
amid the outbreak, including offering the ability to work from 
home.    But those measures are specific to each employer and 
workplaces aren't legally mandated to offer special leave specifically 
for coronavirus.    'There's nothing that fits this circumstance, it's unusual in that sense,' Mr Sivaraman said.      'Substitute coronavirus for the flu and it doesn't change the law.'    'There's
 a lot of misunderstandings and knee-jerk reactions to this and I think 
it is slightly because there's not a specific law to deal with the 
situation.'     Mr Sivaraman said the unprecedented 
outbreak can give employers the right to deny annual leave if a worker 
is seeking to go on holiday at a destination where travel warnings and 
restrictions are in place.    In those cases, they are completely within their rights to take reasonable precautions to make sure the workplace is safe.   The
 Australian government is now weighing its response after Italy declared
 a country-wide travel ban for its 60 million-strong population due to 
the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,800 people 
worldwide.   Employment lawyer at the Maurice Blackburn firm 
Giri Sivaraman said the issue depends on whether an individual is 
actually sick or just required to undergo testing   The 
federal government continues to advise travellers to Italy to 'exercise a
 high degree of caution' and warns they will be subject to health 
screening upon their return.   Meanwhile, temporary school closures 
are likely to become the norm across Australia as the nation also tries 
to batten down the hatches.   Three schools in NSW and Victoria will be shut on Tuesday after three students tested positive to COVID-19.   Three elderly people have died, so far.   Across the world, there have been more than 110,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,817 deaths in 105 countries.   Elsewhere,
 federal Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter will meet with 
unions and employer groups in Sydney on Tuesday to discuss the impact of
 the coronavirus on the economy and business.   Unions want the 
government to compensate Australia's 3.3 million casual workers who 
don't get paid sick leave if they have to self-isolate for up to two 
weeks. The workers are mainly in the retail, hospitality, health and 
aged care sectors.   'We don't want people with virus or people with
 symptoms going to work, but they are going to have to choose between 
paying the bills and feeding themselves or going to work,' ACTU

   Data science from social media could do more than just help track the spread of COVID-19, and when  ... [+]   used properly could help alert users of potential dangers.     On Wednesday the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic 
 a the first time such a declaration has been made since the H1N1 crisis
 in 2009, which saw nearly a quarter of the world's population infected.
  COVID-19,
 the disease that is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been detected 
in more than 100 nations around the globe according to WHO , which 
announced earlier in the week that it was detected in Bulgaria, Costa 
Rica, French Guiana, the Maldives, Malta and Martinique.    The spread of the illness has been tracked worldwide, and its impact noted by American management consulting firm  McKinsey and Company .
 The firm noted the critical indicators of the impact of COVID-19, and 
found that countries such as South Korea and Italy have seen cases grow 
and health care systems stretched. It also warned that global GDP in 
2020 could slide or fall sharply due to the outbreak.     Social Media Tracking    Social media has been an instrumental component of the data 
algorithms being used to track COVID-19's global impact. According to  recent data from Hootsuite Insights, powered by Brandwatch , in just one month the term ""coronavirus"" surpassed over 19 million Twitter mentions in the United States.   In the same period the mentions only reached 2.6 million the U.K., 
which suggested that social media sentiment remained more neutral in the
 U.K. than the U.S., but also highlighted that disgust was the top U.S. 
emotion, with fear continuing on an uphill rise.    ""While thousands have been confirmed with the virus, hundreds of 
millions have been infected/affected with the dread and uncertainty,"" 
explained  Mike Berland, an ex-political pollster and founder/CEO of NY-based data insights firm Decode_M , who has used data science to track the spread of COVID-19.   ""The emotional and business impact currently exceeds the rate of known infection,"" added Berland, author of upcoming book   Maximum Momentum  .
 ""But the uncertainty is paralyzing and itas influenced markets and 
behavior. You can't see it; you can only feel it. We're in a rare 
situation when everyone in the world is directing its attention on the 
same concern, and everybody is equally impacted. In any situation, 
uncertainty always has momentum.""   Data science from social media could do more than just help track the
 spread of the disease, and when used properly could help alert users of
 potential dangers.   ""Momentum of the coronavirus conversation was first driven by online 
new sites and message boards. That remains where most of the 
conversation is,"" explained Berland. ""As awareness has spread and 
individuals are engaging more, there has been a recent surge in momentum
 from social media sites.""    Two
 researchers from Monash University a Mark Andrejevic, professor of 
communications and media studies, and Neil Selwyn, professor of 
education a published a paper  this week that showed how smartphones 
could aid in data tracking, where the handsets could be ""repurposed as 
monitoring systems to support the management and control of the public.""   The researchers noted that smartphones were not only used to share 
facts and information about COVID-19 to the public, but also provided 
information about the public to authorities, which in turn could help 
manage and even control its spread.    An Anti-Social Network    One of the most effective ways that mobile devices have been used to 
monitor the populace is via the Chinese Health Code program, which can 
also be accessed via the popular wallet app Alipay or on platforms such 
as WeChat. It has provided the government with a way to monitor citizens
 to assess risk and even determine quarantine status.   The app provides users with information on whether they're allowed to
 leave homes, use mass transit or whether their respective risk level 
has consigned them to quarantine. Users are categorized a green, yellow 
or red a based on their medical conditions as well as travel history.   A similar app was developed by Chinese-based Tencent for the southern
 city of Shenzhen, and this software also has been used to determine 
whether a person should be allowed to travel in public or should be 
placed in public.    However, there are concerns of how much these ""anti-social media"" programs take the monitoring.  Earlier this month,  The New York Times ,
 which analyzed the software code of these apps, found that the 
information gathered could be shared with the police or other 
authorities . It could set ""template for new forms of automated 
social control that could persist long after the epidemic subsides,"" 
warned the paper of record.    These social media tools could be just the beginning of what we could see come about because of this crisis.   ""Obviously, we don't associate a viral epidemic with innovation, but 
think of it this way,"" added Berland. ""It's a novel problem for our 
times that forces new accommodations.""  "

Actor
 Albert Goikhman captured dramatic footage of the patient dressed in 
black with a blue surgical face mask being wheeled out of the Monash 
Anaesthetic Clinic on Friday.    The patient was strapped into a
 gurney but was alert and looking around at the crowds standing in a 
long coronavirus test queue.    The person was then bundled into an ambulance and taken away as stunned crowds looked on.    Mr Goikhman posted pictures to his Facebook account of the crowds.   Some people were wearing face masks as they queued for hours to get tested.   'And
 you know what is funny about this ... if you don't have coronavirus and
 line up in the queue ... you probably will have after that,' wrote Nola
 Fitch on Facebook.   The queue of people waiting to be 
tested for coronavirus was five-deep in parts as people clogged the 
pavement of Clayton Rd, Clayton in Melbourne on Friday   After
 a wait of between four and five hours, many were successfully tested at
 Monash's fever clinic in Clayton but Daily Mail Australia understands 
some people had to be turned away   The clinic was open from 
10am to 6pm but Daily Mail Australia understands the waiting time was 
four to five hours and an unknown number of people were then turned 
away.   Monash is testing for coronavirus at a second clinic in 
Melbourne's southeastern suburb of Berwick and a third will open in 
Dandenong next week to cope with soaring demand.   Monash Medical 
Centre treated Australia's first confirmed coronavirus patient on 
January 25, a Chinese national who caught the virus in Wuhan and flew to
 Melbourne from Guangzhou on January 19.    As of Friday 
evening there were 201 coronavirus cases across Australia up more 
than a third from the 141 cases confirmed at the same time the day 
before.    A patient was wheeled out of the Monash fever clinic by paramedics in white biohazard suits   Coronavirus cases soared to 201 on Friday   Hundreds
 of people have been lining street corners waiting to be screened 
outside testing centres in Sydney and Melbourne since early this week.   A
 queue outside a test centre at Royal Melbourne Hospital ran for half a 
block on Tuesday evening, with scores of possible patients wearing face 
masks as they waited for a doctor's examination.    New South Wales: 2,182   Victoria: 968   Queensland: 781   Western Australia: 364   South Australia: 337   Australian Capital Territory: 84   Tasmania: 69   Northern Territory: 19    TOTAL CASES:  4,804     RECOVERED: 355     DEAD: 20      At
 Concord Hospital, in Sydney's west, prospective patients sat on plastic
 chairs and leaned against the fence outside a hastily set-up clinic.   Inside
 the city's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, people waiting to see a doctor
 were seated metres apart from one another to minimise the chance of the
 virus spreading.    Officials have confirmed that as of 11am 
on Friday, 16,685 people had been tested for coronavirus in New South 
Wales alone, the country's worst affected state.   A South 
Australian hospital opened the first drive-through coronavirus testing 
clinic on Wednesday to minimise the risk of the disease spreading.   The
 same method has been used with success by South Korea which had more 
than 7900 confirmed cases on Friday night but far fewer comparative 
deaths than other nations such as Iran, Italy or Spain.     Advertisement    "
1482650270,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51879556,2020-03-13,Tech Tent: Controlling coronavirus with apps," It's the first pandemic of the smartphone era - and 
that means governments have access to new ways of tracking the spread of
 Covid-19.    On this week's Tech Tent, we find out about the apps 
that are monitoring people with the virus and look at whether they pose a
 long-term threat to civil liberties.   In South Korea, the 
authorities have created an app that lets them know whether people who 
should be in quarantine have broken the rules. In China, the Health Code
 app, created by the Chinese government and hotted on e-commerce giant 
Alibaba's Alipay platform, lets users know if they are allowed to leave 
home or use public transport. But according to analysis by the New York 
Times, signing up to the apps can mean handing over data about your 
location and identity to the police.   Researchers at Australia's Monash University have been looking at how countries are using tech to manage the virus.    ""This
 is the first pandemic you can access with your smartphone,"" Prof Mark 
Andrejevic tells us. ""And also the first one in which smartphones are 
being used to track people and monitor them and control their 
movements.""   Of
 course, what we often fail to realise is that our smartphones and the 
services on them have been tracking us for years anyway.   If you 
are signed in to Google Maps, it may well have a complete record of 
everywhere you have been for years. If you use an iPhone and store your 
photos in the cloud, Apple will also have a good record of your 
movements and who you have interacted with.   But in some countries, governments have long wanted to get access to this kind of data - and now they have seized their chance.    In
 South Korea, they have gone even further than China in acquiring 
detailed information about people's movements during this health crisis.
 Their app tells users about people near them who have been infected, 
and where they have been.    And that has privacy implications - 
although the information is anonymised it may not be too difficult for 
either app users or the police to work out exactly who each flashing dot
 on the map turns out to be.    Once the system has been put in place,  it could 
continue to be used after this crisis is over. ""There's no reason why 
you couldn't use it for the annual flu season, for example,"" says Prof 
Andrejevic    ""I do think it's possible that we might find our 
concern about the use of information lowered by these moments where 
because of an exceptional circumstance, all of a sudden this data is 
being mobilised.""   In the UK, representatives from Google, 
Facebook, Amazon, Palantir and other tech companies were summoned to 
Downing Street to be asked what they could contribute to the battle 
against the virus.  The discussions centred around how they could 
provide data and expertise to help the National Health Service manage 
what could be a surge in demand.   There is no indication yet that 
the UK government is considering monitoring infected people via an app. 
But as the crisis deepens, all countries will face the same dilemma - 
how much of our privacy are we willing to sacrifice in the battle to 
keep us healthy?     Also on Tech Tent this week:    "

 primary school has banned parents from entering its grounds at pick-up 
and drop-off times in a desperate bid to stop the spread of  coronavirus .   Aitken Hill Primary School, in Craigieburn in  Melbourne 's north, announced the stringent new measures on Monday.   'During
 the afternoon, again we ask that parents do not enter the school 
grounds. We will let students leave as normal except for the Prep 
students,' the school wrote in a letter to parents.   'The Prep team
 and the leadership team will coordinate their dismissal. Our teachers

 Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton argued the decision not to close 
schools was based on how the disease presented in children, and to avoid
 busy health and emergency workers being forced to look after their 
kids.   'There is currently limited information on the contribution of children to transmission of COVID-19,' he wrote in a statement.   'For
 pre-emptive school closures to be effective,  prolonged closure is
 required and it would be unclear when they could be re-opened.   'If
 there were still a large pool of susceptible students when schools are 
re-opened, there would be likely to be re-emergence of transmission in 
the community.'   Some of Victoria's biggest universities are moving
 classes online after a state of emergency was declared in Victoria to 
deal with the spread of COVID-19.   La Trobe, Monash and Swinburne 
universities announced on Monday night that from Tuesday all classes 
will be suspended until the end of the week so staff can prepare for 
online learning.   Swinburne University will pause lectures until 
next week, while those at La Trobe and Monash will be recorded and made 
available online.   Schools in New South Wales have adopted social 
distancing measures, including cancelling assemblies, excursions and 
travel, as well as some events and conferences in a bid to slow the 
spread of the virus.   The Association of Independent Schools of NSW said some of its 500 schools will start teaching students remotely.   St
 Christopher's Catholic Primary School in Panania in Sydney's southwest 
closed on Monday after a person who attended an event hosted by the 
school tested positive for the disease.   The University of Technology Sydney has paused all lectures, tutorials and classes for a week.   Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison told the Today Show on Monday he was following 
the advice of the nation's top doctors and still sending his children to
 school.   'My kids are going to school. I trust the medical advice 
of those who are responsible for the medical health of our nation,' Mr 
Morrison said.   A statement from the Department of Health and Human Services was sent to schools on Monday amid the COVID-19 outbreak    St
 Christopher's Catholic Primary School in Panania in Sydney's southwest 
closed on Monday after a person who attended an event hosted by the 
school tested positive for the disease   'They don't consider 
these things idly, they consider them very carefully. It's a fact that 
younger people are less at risk and there are greater risks in school 
closures.'   There have now been more than 368 cases of coronavirus in Australia, and five people have died.   Globally at least 7,100 have died and 181,800 have been infected.    A
 state of emergency was declared on Monday to enforce the national 
14-day isolation sanctions on all travellers coming into Australia, 
announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the weekend.   Anyone 
returning from overseas will have to self-isolate or risk fines of up to
 $20,000, while police officers will have the power to can detain 
people, restrict movement and prevent entry to premises.   Sydney's Epping Boys High School was briefly closed a fortnight ago after a 16-year-old student tested positive to COVID-19  "

 Sydney corporate lawyer, Monique*, told Daily Mail Australia she flew 
home from a marathon work trip to the United States in late 
February.    Shortly afterwards, the lawyer suffered symptoms 
including a fever, headache and coughing. She was tested for COVID-19 on
 March 9.    But incredibly, the frustrated patient didn't 
receive her results until March 17 - five full working days and a whole 
week later.   Her plight has led the New South Wales government to 
make the extraordinary admission patients who test negative are having 
to wait longer to get their results.     A nurse dressed in personal protective equipment speaks with patients at a new COVID-19 clinic in Adelaide on Tuesday   Lines for testing outside the Royal Melbourne Hospital coronavirus clinic last week - the beginning of an onslaught of testing   Monique
 said: 'It's been widely publicised that the test takes 48 hours - which
 appears to be true if you are a celebrity of a member of parliament.'   'But that is not an accurate reflection of the time it takes at all'.    The
 lawyer said her experience shows the official totals of 'positive' 
cases are running up to a week behind when tests are 
conducted.     A typical COVID-19 test takes about six to eight hours to complete.     New South Wales: 2,182   Victoria: 968   Queensland: 781   Western Australia: 364   South Australia: 337   Australian Capital Territory: 84   Tasmania: 69   Northern Territory: 19    TOTAL CASES:  4,804     RECOVERED: 355     DEAD: 20      A NSW Health Pathology spokeswoman admitted negative results were taking 'several days' to be issued to patients.     The spokeswoman said patients who test positive 'are reported  immediately to the referring doctor and public health unit (PHU) in line with high risk results procedures.    'Negative results are typically issued to the referring doctor and PHU within a day,' the spokeswoman said.    But
 she added: 'The exceptionally high rate of negative results is taking 
several days to be issued to patients with positive patients the 
priority.   Monique's GP said the reason for her hold-up was that 
all tests in greater Sydney were being referred to a lab at Westmead 
Hospital.    The government spokeswoman said the state 
currently has four clinics - the Institute for Clinical Pathology and 
Medical Research at Westmead, Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick, 
Liverpool, and Royal Prince Alfred.    The testing labs are churning through 1500 tests a day.      This
 is what a negative coronavirus test looks like: Monique's test, as 
provided to Daily Mail Australia, warns the disease 'poses a serious 
risk to public health'    
 Paul Komesaroff, the professor of medicine at Monash University, said: 
'You could certainly make the case' official virus numbers are below the
 true number.    'That's not the fault of the authorities.     'It's
 a result of the fact we know there are many infections that are 
asymptomatic, and that the virus is being transmitted within the 
Australian community'.     Prof Komesaroff said Australia
 needs more COVID-19 tests, and hopefully, a 'quicker and more rapidly 
available' way to test for the illness in the future.    While
 Monique languished in quarantine for a week, other patients tested 
recently reported getting their results back within one or two 
days.    Another person who tested negative for the coronavirus
 said a doctor examined her even though she hadn't been abroad, or in 
contact with a known victim.    'I presented at the emergency department at Sydney's Prince of Wales hospital last week,' the patient said.    'I hadn't been abroad, or been in contact with a known victim of the virus, but a lovely doctor agreed to test me anyway.   'I was worried as I developed a really bad cold after a friend had been visiting from abroad and staying in my apartment.    'It turns out a coronavirus patient had been on his Qatar flight to Sydney, but a week previously.   Inside
 Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, patients waiting to see a doctor
 were seated more than a metre apart to prevent the spread of the virus    'I was told those circumstances weren't 'officially' enough to get me tested, but she kindly said she would make an exception.   'Afterwards, I had to go home and self-isolate until I received my test results, but it only took 24 hours.   'But I'm one of the lucky ones, I only waited 90 minutes at the ED and 24 hours for results.    'If I did the same now, just seven days later, who knows what would have happened.'   Another patient, tested at the city's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital just last week, said she had a quick experience.    'I got tested on Monday night, my swabs were taken about 7pm.    'I was told it could take up to 72 hours because they were ""super busy at the moment"". But I found out Wednesday 11am.'     * Not her real name         If
 you believe you have coronavirus you should call your GP or ring the 
national Coronavirus Health Information Hotline on 1800 020 080.      Countries
 must 'test, test, test' to beat the COVID-19 outbreak, the World Health
 Organisation's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 
overnight.    But national guildeines said that only people 
who have returned from overseas, or who have confirmed contact with 
coronavirus sufferers, should be tested.    And as things 
stand, that's the way it should remain, said Paul Komesaroff, the 
professor of medicine at Monash University - because by all reports 
there are not enough test kits.    'There's still strong 
justification for limiting the availability for the tests simply on the 
basis that the resources are extremely limited,' Prof Komesaroff 
said.     'It's very clear what we need is availability 
both of this test but perhaps more importantly of a future yet to be 
developed test which is much quicker and more readily available.'    Australian
 National University infectious diseases expert Dr Sanjaya Senanayake 
said he believed the WHO advice was aimed at countries other than 
Australia.    Australian National University infectious diseases expert Dr Sanjaya Senanayake   'I
 think he was targeting those countries that are out of control in terms
 of their transmission such as Italy, rather than countries like 
Australia,' he said.     'The message overall is of course it's important to test but particularly for those countries out of control at the moment.'    Dr Senanayake said he 'hoped' the true number of coronavirus cases was not much bigger than the official test results.   "

 usage as thousands of Australians confine themselves to their homes 
amid a looming  coronavirus  lockdown.     The
 National Broadband Network (NBN) revealed it is already experiencing a 
spike in traffic as more workers are being told to work from home to 
prevent further spread of COVID-19.     A potential 
lockdown, which can see as many hundreds of thousands of employees 
working remotely, has sparked concerns NBN will not be able to cope with
 the unprecedented level of pressure,  The New Daily  reported.    The
 National Broadband Network (NBN) revealed it is already experiencing a 
spike in traffic as more workers are being told to work from home to 
prevent further spread of COVID-19   The overload of 
data usage could even lead to restrictions on Netflix and other 
streaming services, which take up 70 to 80 per cent of the load in the 
country   'These are unprecedented times and we are already 
seeing a steady increase in demand on the NBN, and this is set to 
continue,' chief executive Stephen Rue said.   'For many 
Australians, the NBN and other broadband and mobile networks will become
 the primary channel for work, study, entertainment, ordering food and 
maintaining contact with the outside world.'    However, Telsoc vice president Laurie Patton NBN wasn't ready to face the spike in traffic.   'Working
 from home requires the ability to send large amounts of data as well as
 receive data. The reality is fibre is symmetrical - it can deliver fast
 broadband in both directions. FTTN is slow going down but impossibly 
slower going up,' she told the ABC.   'Mathias Cormannn has predicted that businesses will go broke due to the coronavirus. Our inferior NBN won't help.'   The
 overload of data usage could even lead to restrictions on Netflix and 
other streaming services, which take up 70 to 80 per cent of the load in
 the country, according to Telstra's Michael Ackland.    Communications
 Minister Paul Fletcher on Monday held a teleconference with senior 
executives of NBN Co, Optus, Telstra, Vodafone, TPG and Vocus.   The
 companies have set up a working group to share information with each 
around issues emerging from the virus, such as engineering, security and
 operations.    'Our telcos are quickly responding to the 
evolving challenges of COVID-19 and have in place business continuity 
plans to continue to deliver vital telecommunications services,' Mr 
Fletcher said.   A growing list of companies have ordered their staff to work from home (stock image)   The
 companies are bracing from the increase in network traffic after Italy 
reported a 26 per cent increase in fixed line peak hour network traffic 
because of more people working from home.   The telcos are also 
awaiting advice from the government on how to protect technicians 
against customers that are self-isolating.    Some of

 every school in Victoria to help prevent the spread of coronavirus 
could currently do more harm than good, Premier Daniel Andrews has 
stressed.   Another 23 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in Victoria overnight, taking the state's total number of positive tests to 94.   Toorak
 Primary School in Melbourne's inner southeast has closed for at least 
24 hours from Tuesday after a teacher was confirmed as being infected.   Schools
 in general have not been told to close, but some private schools - 
including Ballarat Grammar, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Loreto 
Mandeville Hall, St Kevin's and Yeshiva-Beth Rivkah College - have 
decided to shut their gates regardless.   Victorian Chief Health 
Officer Brett Sutton says the decision not to close schools was based on
 how the disease presented in children, and to avoid busy health and 
emergency workers being forced to look after their children.   It comes as non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned.   Mr Andrews insists it's the right call.   ""I
 know many, many parents are anxious, they're concerned, and I know to a
 certain extent it's a bit counterintuitive that schools remain open,"" 
he told reporters on Tuesday.   ""But the advice is, closing schools
 now - that's not to say they won't close at some stage in the future - 
but if we were to close them now, across the board, that could make a 
very difficult set of circumstances even worse.   ""It could do more harm than good.""   Victorian
 Education Minister James Merlino said the advice is that it is best to 
close schools closer to the peak of the infection.   If government schools are closed down, teachers will continue to be paid and will keep working on their laptops, he said.   The City of Melbourne is looking at how to increase support for the elderly and homeless.   Mayor
 Sally Capp said the council is making sure it has access to hundreds of
 meals to deliver to the elderly, if organisations usually involved in 
such deliveries are shut down, and premises to accommodate rough 
sleepers are being examined.   Some of Victoria's biggest

 collaboration focused on cutting delays, emissions and waste from 
building projects has received a grant of 28 million Australian dollars 
($16.40 million) from the country's government.    The scheme, 
called Building 4.0 CRC, is made of up 30 partners including Lendlease, 
Monash University, the University of Melbourne and the Donovan Group.   In
 an announcement Wednesday, the University of Melbourne said the funding
 would leverage 103 million Australian dollars from research partners, 
government and industry.   While the University of Melbourne's own 
statement did not go into specifics, it did lay out several aims for the
 research initiative. These include: Harnessing digital technology 
and off-site manufacturing to cut project costs by 30%; reducing 
construction waste by 80%; and lowering carbon dioxide emissions by 50%.
    The collaboration will also look to use things such as 
artificial intelligence and data science. According to the Building 4.0 
CRC website, other targets include training 36 PhDs and 1,000 Masters 
students as well as ""training 7,000 apprentices in new technologies.""   In
 Australia, CRC refers to the Australian government's Cooperative 
Research Centres Program, which backs research, industry and the 
community through grants.      ""Our vision is to create a 
world where people can visualise and realise buildings in real time,"" 
Gavin Tonnet, who is Australian CEO of the Donovan Group, said in a 
statement.    ""The purpose is to transform the way that 
consumers and builders design and buy buildings by providing easy-to-use
 browsing-based software that allows them to custom-design, visualise 
and price buildings in an engineering compliant way,"" Tonnet added.   Technology
 is transforming the construction industry in a number of ways. These 
include processes such as building information modeling, or BIM. The 
multinational business Arup has described BIM as a ""virtual prototype"" 
which enables ""any aspect of a design's performance to be simulated and 
assessed before it is built.""    In an interview  previously broadcast by CNBC ,
 Dean Banks, from international infrastructure group Balfour Betty, 
outlined some of the changes that could take place in the construction 
industry.   ""In the future we think that robotics will play a big 
part,"" Banks, who is CEO of U.K. Construction Services at the firm, 
explained.   ""We've seen drones making decisions, we think 
information modelling will be in place, (and) 3D printing,"" he added. 
People would be operating a building site from a control center 
elsewhere, Banks said, something he described as ""quite a massive 
change.""  "

 people leap out of bed in the morning, raring to go. Others need an 
alarm clock a preferably two a to get them off to work on time.    My
 wife will quite happily stay up working until the small hours, while I 
prefer to head for bed soon after 10pm. Iam itching to leave a party by 
11pm; she is just warming up. Itas pretty clear that Iam a lark; Clare 
is an owl.    The extent to which you are owl-ish or 
lark-oriented is called your achronotypea, and it is something that is 
rooted in your genes.    Some people leap out of bed in 
the morning, raring to go. Others need an alarm clock a preferably two a
 to get them off to work on time (file photo)   However, if 
your sleep isnat as great as youad want, or if, like me, youave suffered
 from insomnia for years, it is important to understand whether you are 
more lark or owl, because those tendencies exert huge control over your 
body clock (your circadian rhythms) and the natural chemical drivers 
that help you fall asleep and sleep soundly.    Luckily, I have
 discovered that it is possible to re-tune your circadian clock and get 
your body back into the synchronisation necessary for good sleep by 
making a few straight-forward tweaks. These involve making sure you eat 
the right food, at the right time, and that you get exposure to strong 
enough light, again at the right time.   All this week in the Daily Mail I have been serialising my brilliant new book,  Fast Asleep , which brings together the latest scientifically proven ways to improve sleep.   If
 you sleep badly, thereas every chance your clock has become disrupted, 
but the really good news is that it can be changed to improve your sleep
 quality, and Iall show you how. Oddly enough, your circadian clock 
doesnat follow a day that is exactly 24- hours long. Some peopleas clock
 runs fast, othersa runs slow.    If you have a fast clock then
 that means you are a lark a you like to get up early. If you have a 
slow clock then you are an owl, someone who likes to stay up late.    A
 while ago I did a genetic test which confirmed what I had long 
suspected: that I am one of those people whose circadian clock is a 
little fast.    However, if your sleep isnat as great as
 youad want, or if, like me, youave suffered from insomnia for years, it
 is important to understand whether you are more lark or owl   I
 also have a marker for increased risk of insomnia and one which is 
associated with poor sleep efficiency in people who are exposed to high 
levels of work-related stress.    All this knowledge is fine if
 you live a rarefied life which allows you to go to bed and wake up when
 your clock demands it.    However, in the real world we often 
have to get up horribly early when our body would much rather be asleep,
 or work late at night when every cell in your body is screaming for 
sleep.    Pushing your natural chronotype beyond its boundaries
 night after night can easily disrupt your circadian rhythm, ruining 
your sleep and putting you at risk of insomnia.    This is 
important, because when your biological clocks get out of sync with
 the outside world, and with each other, you are in trouble.    Not
 only will you struggle to sleep, but you will get hungry, have problems
 controlling your blood sugar levels, feel run down and tired, and find 
it hard to concentrate.    Itas called asocial jet laga, 
because just like the jet lag you experience after travelling across 
multiple time zones, it leaves you feeling terrible.    WHY DO CHILDREN WAKE EARLY?    A
 big study of 25,000 people of all ages found that while most children 
are larks, they become progressively more owlish through the teenage 
years, hitting maximum aowla at around 20.    They try to sneak
 their phones up to their bedrooms, stay up late chatting to their 
friends on social media and are hard to rouse in the morning.    They
 grunt at breakfast, refuse your healthy offerings and instead buy junk 
food and energy drinks on the way to school to wake themselves up.    This
 behaviour might be really annoying but, to some extent, itas not their 
fault. Puberty shifts the internal clock to a later setting, by an 
average of one to two hours.    So an angelic child who was 
once quite happy to go to bed by 9.30pm and get up at 7am (getting the 
necessary ten hours in bed) suddenly morphs into a stroppy teenager who 
resents being sent to bed at all and resents even more getting up at 
7am, after having managed less than seven hoursa sleep.    One
 of the main things that keeps people awake at night is worrying about 
staying awake and the terrible consequences of not getting to sleep 
(file photo)   There are clear gender differences too. Girls, 
who tend to hit puberty earlier than boys, start turning owlish earlier,
 reaching amaximum owla at 19, before slowly becoming more 
larkish.    Boys, on the other hand, have a body clock that 
tends to get them to bed later and later, until they hit the age of 21 
and have to fit into the adult world. ANonetheless, they tend to remain 
more owlish than women until they hit their 50s, when gender differences
 disappear.    This might cause conflict at home, but perhaps this is what nature intended.    When
 kids are young, it is vital that their parents nurture and look after 
them. But as they grow older, they need to start to assert their own 
identity, to prepare for life outside the parental home, where they will
 have to fend for themselves.    Staying up late, with other 
teenagers, while the parents are all asleep, may be natureas way of 
bonding the next generation together.     DON'T WORRY ABOUT STAYING AWAKE    One
 of the main things that keeps people awake at night is worrying about 
staying awake and the terrible consequences of not getting to 
sleep.    Thoughts like: aI wonat get to sleep and if I donat then I will feel really tired at work tomorrow and get the sack.a    Itas important to realise that these thoughts are not real. Try giving your negative thoughts a name, like aDonalda.    So when you have them you can say: aThat is just Donald sounding off again.a    Challenging yourself like this sounds crazy, but it works.    Another
 way of approaching your catastrophic or negative thoughts is by 
imagining what a sympathetic friend would say to you if you were to 
share them. What would they say? How would they help to ground 
you?    It is also important to realise that at night your 
filters are down, and you are more vulnerable to inner demons, so any 
thoughts you might have at night will inevitably be less rooted in 
reality than the negative thoughts you have during the day.    But once your sleep improves, you will find those negative thoughts easier to stamp out.     Say no to cocoa    Any
 fat you consume will also cause fat levels in your blood to rise 
further and faster than they would earlier in the day and take longer to
 fall (file photo)    A cup of hot chocolate or a bowl of cereal just before bed may sound soothing but actually it is a bad idea.      Your
 pancreas (which produces insulin) will have closed down for the night, 
so it wonat be ready for the big sugar hit that cereal or cocoa will 
deliver. This will cause your blood sugars to rise and keep on rising 
into the night, which is bad for sleep as well as for your body.      Any
 fat you consume will also cause fat levels in your blood to rise 
further and faster than they would earlier in the day and take longer to
 fall. A few years ago, I did an experiment on myself in which I ate 
exactly the same high-fat, high-carb meal at 10am and 10pm.      Whereas
 my fat and blood sugar levels rose and fell quite quickly after the 
morning meal, in the evening they were both still rising well after 
midnight.      Another good reason to avoid a 
late-night snack or glass of milk is that any protein in the food will 
cause your stomach to release acid. Particularly if you suffer from acid
 reflux, itas advisable to stay away from anything but water in the two 
hours running up to bedtime.    Once you have given your diet a
 more Mediterranean twist, increasing your intake of vegetables and 
pulses that your gut bacteria love (as explained in Tuesdayas paper), 
and you have created the perfect bedtime routine (as I outlined 
yesterday), you might find the suggestions I make below are enough to 
significantly improve your sleep quality.    Thatas because one
 of the most important drivers of sleep is your circadian rhythm. This 
is a 24- hour internal clock which runs in the background of your brain,
 cycling between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals.    Anyone can become a morning person     You really can turn yourself from an owl into a lark in just three weeks a and without medical intervention.      You
 just need to reset your internal clocks by controlled and strategic 
exposure to light and the timing of your meals. This should make it 
easier for you to fall asleep at night, and ensure you are more alert 
and energetic during the day.      Thatas because your main internal clock, the one in the centre of your brain, is mainly controlled by light.      Rays
 of light from the sun hit receptors in the back of your eyes that send 
messages to a tiny region of the brain (called the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus or SCN) which control our circadian rhythms.     Like light and darkness, when you eat has a powerful effect on re-synchronising your body clocks, too (file photo)    The
 light triggers signals to other parts of your body, including your 
guts, letting them know that a new day has begun and it is time to get 
moving. The SCN also raises your core body temperature before you wake, 
so you are ready to get going.      What makes 
things a bit more complicated is the fact that each of our organs has 
its own clock, which is linked to the main clock but not necessarily 
driven by it. The clock in your liver, for example, is not reset by 
light, but by when you eat.      Like light and darkness, when you eat has a powerful effect on re-synchronising your body clocks, too.      To
 show it can be done, researchers from Monash University in Australia 
recruited 22 owls, men and women who normally go to bed around 2.30am 
and wake up at 10am.      For three weeks they were asked to follow nine simple rules. These were:       1.  To wake up at least two hours earlier than normal, which for this group meant getting up by 8am.       2.  To get outside and expose themselves to plenty of outdoor light in the mornings.       3.  To have breakfast as soon as convenient.       4.  To only exercise in the morning.       5.  To have lunch at the same time every day.       6.  To avoid all caffeine after 4pm.       7.  To avoid having a nap after 4pm.       8.  To avoid bright lights during the evening and to head to bed a couple of hours earlier than normal (by about midnight).      9.  To stick to this regime every day of the week, including weekends.      After three weeks, the owls had successfully shifted their body clocks forward by an impressive two hours.      Not
 only were they going to sleep earlier, but tests showed that their 
levels of melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone, were peaking two hours 
earlier.      1. Do you wake up bright and cheerful, without an alarm clock, by 7am?     2. If you go to bed at 10pm, do you swiftly fall asleep?      3. Do you always try to head to bed before midnight, even if you are on holiday?      4. Or do you have trouble falling asleep before midnight?      5. Do you need an alarm clock to drag you out of bed in the morning?      6. Do you find you donat need to eat until later in the day and are happy with just a coffee?      7. Given the chance, would you sleep in till 11am or later?      If you answered ayesa to the first three questions and anoa to the last four, you have strong larkish tend     Having shifted their body clocks they felt far less sleepy during the day and were happier with their lives.      Their
 depression and stress scores improved, as did their performance in 
cognitive tests. They even got physically stronger.      This is all part of a pattern I try to follow on a daily basis to keep my circadian rhythms in sync.      I
 set an early alarm (7am), run through a series of resistance exercises 
(press up and squats) then when I have time I take our dog out for a 
30-minute walk before breakfast.      Part of the 
benefit is the exercise, but part is exposing myself to lots of early 
morning light which should reset my internal clock and let my body know 
the day has begun.      During long dark winters I 
sit and work by a light box just to reinforce those early morning light 
triggers (and boost my levels of vitamin D).      I 
only have coffee before midday, I never nap (even when Iam desperate to 
just lie down and shut my eyes for a few moments), and I dim the lights 
around the house in the evening, getting to bed before midnight.      If you are really owlish an even quicker way to convert yourself to a lark could be to go camping.      A
 few years ago a U.S. researcher sent eight people on a camping trip 
with wrist monitors to record how much light they were being exposed to,
 and activity monitors to measure how much sleep they were 
getting.      During the week they were away 
camping, they were not allowed torches or mobile phones, and the only 
light they saw at night was from candles or the campfire. Because they 
were living outdoors, their monitors confirmed that over the course of 
the week they were exposed to four times their normal levels of 
light.      This had a big effect on their sleeping 
patterns and their sleep fell into closer sync with sunrise and sunset. 
Before the trip, their average bedtime was 12.30am; by the time they got
 home it was more like 11pm.      Blood tests showed
 their bodies had started to release melatonin two hours earlier than 
they had before the trip a they had turned from owls to larks in just 
one week.     The Mosley cure for jetlag    Not
 many people will be travelling right now, but when the world returns to
 normal, as it surely must one day, flying will still present sleep 
problems.    Since jet lag is caused by the imbalance between 
your internal body clock and your new time zone, the journeys with the 
most brutal effect are the ones that involve flying through multiple 
time zones.    Before I found ways of coping, jet lag would 
leave me feeling dazed and irritable, madly craving carbs at crazy times
 of the day and night.    The good news is there are things you can do to reduce its impact.    Below is an example of what I do to minimise jet lag, based on experience and chats with air crew and sleep experts.    The journeys with the most brutal effect are the ones that involve flying through multiple time zones (file photo)   If
 I am heading to New York a five hours behind the UK a I like to get an 
early-afternoon flight. When I get up, I skip breakfast and aim not to 
eat until at least 1pm (9am New York time). This afasta helps to reset 
your body clock.    At the airport, I set my watch to New York 
time, then walk around a lot. I do squats and use airport chairs to
 dotriceps dips. I donat drink any alcohol or caffeine. If I get a 1pm 
flight, I will have a light lunch on the plane, and then nothing until I
 have a high-protein evening meal when I get to my hotel (around 
6pm).    I go to bed at 9pm, having swallowed a melatonin capsule and a sleeping pill.    The
 next morning, I get up at around 6am and when it is light I go for a 
30-minute walk (or run, if Iam feeling energetic). Then I have a 
proteinrich breakfast, such as eggs, and get on with my day.    I
 normally take melatonin on the second night, and sometimes a sleeping 
pill. I find that within a day or two I can sleep happily without 
them.    On the way back to London, I get an early-evening 
flight, after lunch at 2pm. I skip dinner and, with the aid of melatonin
 and a sleeping pill, try to get to sleep. I also skip breakfast on the 
plane.    When I get home, after a 14-hour fast, I have 
breakfast. I go for a brisk mid-morning walk. I have a light lunch, a 
protein-rich evening meal and go to bed at my normal time, after taking a
 melatonin capsule and a sleeping pill. This usually works brilliantly.    Shift work survival guide     Any job that involves shift work is likely to be a sleep killer a and the effects can last a lifetime.    Jet
 lag and shift work have a lot in common. In both cases your internal 
body clock is thrown out of sync with the external world, and this has a
 number of unfortunate consequences.    In the case of jet lag,
 the impact can be unpleasant, but it tends not to be long term (unless 
you do an awful lot of travelling). For shift workers it can be truly 
life-changing. There is a long list of terrible things that prolonged 
shift work can do to the human body, ranging from increased risk of 
heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and obesity, through early 
menopause to depression and divorce.    There are some people 
who cope well with shift work, but being older and female seems to make 
it harder to adapt. Those over the age of 45 are less able to adapt to 
shift work, and the impact on their bodies and brains is greater.    My son, Jack, is a junior doctor and every few weeks he has to do a couple of nights on call, from 9pm to 9am.    Jack
 has a nap in the afternoon before work, and a meal in the early 
evening. He also takes food into the hospital to eat before midnight, as
 the only alternative is something out of a vending machine. He 
practises time restricted eating (TRE), trying not to eat between 
midnight and 9am, when he finishes work.    Instead, he drinks 
lots of water and tea. He also takes a sleeping bag into the 
hospital with him and, depending on how busy he is, sometimes manages to
 get a bit of sleep on the floor of the doctorsa office. He finds that a
 short nap in the early hours means he feels less tired when driving 
home after a night on call.    Fortunately, there are things you can do to make shift work more tolerable.     TOP TIPS TO KEEP HEALTHY ON SHIFT      1.  Before
 your shift begins, take a long nap. If you can, try to get the majority
 of your sleep in the hours leading up to starting your shift.    There
 is evidence that if you are working a night shift, say from 11pm to 
7am, it is better to have an evening sleep (from 2pm till 9pm) rather 
than a morning sleep (8am to 3pm).    Put together a bag with 
healthy snacks to take with you. The kind of food available from vending
 machines is likely to be high in sugar, saturated fat and salt, and low
 in fibre and nutrients.    When you eat junk food you pack in 
the calories and are soon hungry again. Plus, the fact that you are 
eating at night, when your body will find it hard to process food, means
 the bad stuff will hang around in your system for longer.    So
 try to eat your main meal before midnight, and take in nuts, apples and
 pears to snack on if you canat endure a long night without 
anything.    Take in a bottle of water, from the fridge, to sip during overnight shifts. Do not drink caffeinated fizzy drinks.     2.  While
 youare at work, during the early hours of your night shift, make sure 
you are getting exposure to bright light.    If your workplace 
is poorly lit, consider bringing in a light box a such as the Lumie 
Vitamin L SAD light, APS75 from John Lewis a to give yourself a 20-minute 
blast. It is more effective and certainly healthier than 
caffeine.      Do try TRE. Studies show it is bad for
 the heart if you eat when your body thinks it should be asleep, and 
researchers are currently looking into the health benefits of limiting 
your aeating windowa (avoiding eating anything between 1am and 6am) when
 youare on a night shift.    If you get the chance, try to grab a 20 to 40 minute nap at some point during your shift.     3.  When
 you are travelling home after a night shift wear dark glasses to avoid 
light exposure. Rather than going straight to bed, delay your sleep 
until the afternoon if you can, as research shows this is less 
disruptive for your body clock.    You will probably need ear plugs, a sleep mask and a prominent aDo Not Disturba sign on the bedroom door.    You
 should also pay attention to the classic sleep hygiene routines I 
recommended in yesterdayas pull-out (a fixed time when you go to sleep 
and wake up; a strict countdown to your bedtime routine; no caffeine or 
alcohol before bedtime).     Beware the power of caffeine    Caffeine
 works by binding to sleep-inducing receptors in your brain that would 
otherwise be occupied by adenosine, the natural hormone which helps you 
feel sleepy.    If you are feeling sleepy and want to stay 
awake, you can temporarily block the effects of adenosine with a cup of 
coffee. But be warned a relying on caffeine to jolt you awake may mean 
paying the price in disturbed sleep later.    The problem is, 
some people metabolise caffeine more efficiently than others. Mostly 
this is a matter of genetics, but your ability to sleep after a 
caffeine-fuelled day will vary according to gender, age, weight and any 
medication you are on.    Taking the oral contraceptive Pill, for instance, will dramatically slow your liveras ability to break down caffeine.    Caffeine
 works by binding to sleep-inducing receptors in your brain that would 
otherwise be occupied by adenosine, the natural hormone which helps
 you feel sleepy (file photo)   The average half-life of 
caffeine is around five hours, which means that if you have a cup of 
coffee at 6pm, half that caffeine will still be running around your 
system at 11pm and a quarter is still there at 4am.    If you are sensitive to caffeine, you could be kept awake in the middle of the night by a late-morning cup of coffee.    The
 average half-life of caffeine may be five hours, but the range can vary
 from just over one hour to up to nine hours. These days, I have two or 
three cups of coffee during the morning and rarely drink any after 
midday.    Adapted by Louise Atkinson from Fast Asleep.      Fast Asleep

 Melbourne and all other poker machine venues around the country should 
be closed to slow the coronavirus outbreak, Monash University associate 
professor Charles Livingstone said.   The

have exemptions from each stateas health authorities to keep operating.    Related:   'Outrageous': Qantas criticised for standing down 20,000 workers without pay    Both venues have closed every second poker machine, but high-roller rooms and restaurants remain open.   Crown
 on Thursday said it would reduce the number of people allowed at any 
one time in its restaurants from 450, a number set only on Monday, to 
100.   And trade in high-roller rooms is understood to have been dramatically cut by international travel bans.   But
 Livingstone, a sociologist and gambling researcher who has long been a 
critic of Crown, said the restrictions still left about 1,400 poker 
machines operating at the Melbourne casino.   He
 and 10 other public health experts have written a letter to state 
health ministers and federal health minister Greg Hunt calling for all 
poker machine venues to be closed to slow the transmission of Covid-19.   Poker machine buttons and screens were asweaty, stinky and pretty horriblea, he said.   aThe capacity of Crown to wipe down machines between users is virtually impossible,a he said.   aCrown should be shut down now and so should all the pokie joints.a   Victorian

said premier Daniel Andrews should explain why Crown aisnat required to 
follow the same restrictions as everybody elsea.   aEven
 Nevada, USA, a state which is home to the casino capital of the world, 
has made the decision to shut down its casinos,a she said.   aDaniel
 Andrews must tell us why Crown Casino does not need to comply with the 
advice provided to all other venues which have been instructed to limit 
patronage to less than 100.a   Crown is already under fire over a  laundry list of allegations  that are being investigated by a  NSW public inquiry  that has, itself, had its hearings postponed due to the virus crisis.   The
 groupas casinos employ 18,500 people, meaning closing them would 
deliver a savage hit to employment in Perth and Melbourne at a time when
 people are already being laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic.   Crown
 is allowed to keep operating under an exemption provided by Victoriaas 
chief health officer, Brett Sutton, which Guardian Australia understands
 is in writing.   Andrewsa office is yet to provide Guardian Australia with a copy of the exemption that was requested on Thursday morning.   The premier did not answer directly when asked by reporters on Thursday how the casino qualified as an essential service.   However he said the government was acting according to Suttonas advice.   aThe moment that advice changes, we will change the arrangements for them,a he said.   aItas a unique space.   aThe chief health officer is confident that the arrangements that have been put in place are appropriate.a  "

 are a must as social distancing pushes Australians further apart, as 
experts turn their noses up at coronavirus panic buying.   Etiquette
 experts say being polite is crucial even as COVID-19 prompts health 
authorities to encourage a 1.5-metre space between people.   ""We 
can social distance in a way that is not offensive, and respectful to 
others,"" Australian Finishing School chief executive officer Amanda King
 told AAP on Thursday.   ""Communicating in a kind, respectful, polite manner.""   Eye contact, a head nod and smiling could be greeting solutions.   ""Due
 to this current crisis, rules governing interaction between people are 
more relevant than ever,"" the accredited etiquette expert said.   ""We
 need to be leaders in society with manners and actions around being 
considerate and polite, for example the grocery store hours for 
disability and the elderly.""   Panic buying has cleared supermarket shelves, leaving the vulnerable and elderly unable to buy food and other staples.   Monash
 University social philosopher Elizabeth Burns Coleman said the social 
norms of staying out of people's space had been widened.   ""Politeness is always about being appropriate to a situation,"" Dr Burns Coleman told AAP on Thursday.   ""Clear signal to others what you are doing. That allows people to interpret what is going on.""   Health
 authorities want people to exercise ""social distancing"" measures, such 
as sitting in the back of a taxi as well as the 1.5m advice.   It comes alongside a limit on outdoor gatherings to less than 500 people and indoor gatherings to no more than 100.   Friends keen to meet in person may want to greet with air kissing while colleagues could head nod, Dr Burns Coleman suggested.   ""It should be playful. This is a great time to experiment. Pick up what works,"" she said.   ""We
 are going to evolve a whole new set of dynamics around social 
distancing. In some regards these ... will be things we adapt in the 
longer term.""   Face masks could become a new normal in a bid to protect others from a person sharing their illness, she suggested.   But don't forgot to exercise good hygiene.   For those not willing to meet in person, friends can have a night in with a Netflix Party, thanks to a Google Chrome extension.   It allows viewers to tune into the same show, and chat while it runs.   Swinburne
 University of Technology media studies lecturer Liam Burke said 
streaming shows first pushed people apart, but the tide had turned.   ""What
 that crisis has done has forced us back into close proximity and ... 
that need for social glue at a time of social distancing,"" Dr Burke 
said. But remember, always use your manners.     Advertisement    "

The quarterbacks coach for the Brown University Bears,  to be precise. That's a new title, but she's been a coach practically half her life.    But
 because Marini is female, she is ""the first female position coach 
in Division I history."" So the question about what that distinction 
means to her has come up in recent days since her promotion. She 
claimed she still doesn't have a great answer for it. It's still a 
pretty good one.    ""Honestly, I think itas great that there is
 a first because it means there will be a anext,'"" Marini said by phone 
Tuesday, a day after Brown made her promotion from offensive quality 
control assistant to quarterbacks coach official.    ""There are
 so many women that I have met through this journey and through this 
process that are going to make great position coaches, that are going to
 make great offensive coordinators, that are going to make excellent 
head coaches. By being the first, that means someone else is going to 
come along.""    SPORTS SHUTDOWN: Latest news on coronavirus shutdown delivered to you.   Sign up here.     NBA CORONAVIRUS:  Adam Silver remains optimistic about salvaging season; defends player testing    It just so happened Marini's turn came before everyone else.    ""I
 donat think itas the worldas biggest deal,"" she said in 
her Australian accent. ""And itas certainly not the biggest 
deal in the world to the staff here at Brown, who have been fantastic.""   The road from Australia to Providence, Rhode Island, was not direct.    aI feel like I need a prerecorded version of this story now,a she said with a laugh.   It
 basically goes like this. A girl who grew up in a small Australian 
town played every sport under the sun but gravitated toward 
tennis and netball (a game similar to basketball). At college, she 
majored in emergency health at Monash University, but the degree may as 
well have read ""coaching,"" Marini said. Her dream was to coach the 
Australian national netball team.   About a decade ago, she met
 Kieren Marini, an Australian who grew up watching the NFL 
with his dad and is now her husband of nearly five years. At first, both
 Kieren and Heather assumed her first football game would be her last. 
She watched from the sideline on a freezing, rainy day.    ""She
 was like, 'I donat think Iall ever love the sport like you do.' Which 
is kind of funny because of where she is now,"" he said.    Kieren said the game lasted more than four hours; Heather believed it was closer to five-and-a-half.   aI thought, aThis is the craziest sport Iave ever seen. Iam not sure Iam that interested. Good luck!aa Heather said.    As
 they dated, Kieren kept playing, and Heather became a trainer for 
the club. Then she advanced to strength and conditioning coach.   aThe more I started learning about the sport, the more I got involved,a she said.   In
 2010, Marini landed an internship with the Oregon State Beavers 
in the strength and conditioning department. She loved it, but her 
heart wasnat in the weight room. It was on the field.   ""In 
Australia, all that strength and conditioning was done out on the field.
 So we didnat really delineate between sports-specific drills and 
strength and conditioning drills,"" Marini said. ""I went back to 
Australia with that knowledge of, aActually, I want to be on the field.a
 And I got more and more involved.""   Back at Monash, she began coaching the U-19 team, with the Warriors finding success as one of the younger teams in the leagues.   Kierenas
 work as a cancer researcher (he holds a PhD and works at the 
University of California, San Francisco) brought the couple to the 
U.S. As they prepared for the move in 2017, Marini 
attended the NFL Womenas Careers in Football Forum. She made 
two life-changing contacts there: NFL senior director 
Samantha Rapoport, who pushed her to apply for jobs, and Brown
 head coach James Perry, who was then leading Bryant 
University.    It dawned on 
Marini that coaching could be a career rather than a hobby. After all, 
her coaching efforts in Australia were solely volunteer. Once she 
received a working permit in the U.S., she embarked on her 
own coaching tour.   ""I call it my aDIYa internship year,"" 
Marini said. ""I had a lot of coaches that were really supportive of
 me and let me come to practice and sit and watch film and all that sort
 of thing. Met a lot of folks, went to a lot of clinics.""     She
 broke into the professional ranks in 2018 by earning a pro scouting 
fellowship with the New York Jets, spending six weeks with the team 
before the season started. A few months later, when Perry was forming a 
new staff at his alma mater, he  hired three women to his quality 
control staff a including Marini.    ""Heather has earned 
the coaching position,"" Perry said in a statement. ""In one 
season with our program, Heather has done a great job for us. She 
has proven through her efforts in the office every day with us in an 
off-the-field role that she's ready to run the quarterback room.""   At
 Brown, Marini will have the luxury of coaching E.J. Perry, a Boston 
College transfer who set league records in 2019. The Bears play fast and
 run a lot of plays, which Marini enjoys.    ""How can I take 
the playbook or the skill that weare trying to teach and get the best 
out of the player? How do I use my words and my demonstrations and the 
drills I create in order to get them to execute at the highest possible 
level?"" she said, describing her style.   ""My coaching philosophy 
was: Develop thinking players, always developing, always moving forward,
 always building, getting them to really think about not just their job 
on the field but whatas happening around them as well as, now that Iam 
here in the U.S., how theyare developing as student-athletes.""    And Marini has more in mind for her future -- she would like to eventually call plays and become a head coach.   The
 path to becoming a position coach in the Division I ranks usually 
involves going from player to graduate assistant, to assistant, 
with those individuals a all men until this point a relying on personal 
networks and connections.    Kieren, who tries to FaceTime 
Heather every day from California (it helps that he craves 
nitty-gritty football information), realizes his wife reached 
that level the hard way.    ""I donat think you can 
understate how much work she is putting into this,"" he said. ""I 
guess a lot of paths American coaches have is very built into the 
system.""    That system couldn't deny Heather Marini, and now she's a part of it.    "

When Stanford Graduate School of Business canceled in-person classes 
for the remainder of the quarter to combat the spread of coronavirus, 
faculty moved quickly to take their lessons online. Some 125 class 
sections went virtual in 72 hours. Overall, about 100 Stanford GSB 
faculty lectured and hosted office hours through online conferencing 
tools like Zoom and Canvas, and students met in small groups or over the
 phone for group projects. Some in-class assignments became papers, and 
final presentations turned into virtual presentations.   Economics professor and avid Twitter user  Susan Athey  (@Susan_Athey)  turned to social media 
 to ask other professors how they successfully flipped their classes: 
aStarting an open-ended conversation for faculty who are taking their 
courses online in a hurry,a she announced. aWhat are tips and tricks? 
What challenges are you facing?a   Responses came in from around the world and showed a variety of preferred technologies.   At the University of Bologna in Italy, associate professor of economics Emilio Calvano ( @EmilioC_ )
 says 90% of the classes went online within three or four days of the 
national quarantine. The research institutionas 80,000 students are 
using Microsoft Teams, which offers a virtual whiteboard and screen 
share, as well as a chat room he uses for student questions and 
comments. Students tend to keep webcams off, though, he notes. aYou lose
 all feedback coming from facial expression and body language,a he said 
on Twitter. aI miss that very much. You basically have no feedback.a   At Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, associate professor Paul Raschky ( @PaulRaschky )
 has divided his lectures into small videos, each 10 to 15 minutes long,
 recorded with a simple webcam and microphone in his office. Class 
discussions take place over Zoom and through a live stream, and his 
office hours take place using YouTube Live. aThe students liked the 
group chat function to ask questions (maybe because of the Twitch 
feeling?),a he wrote. (For those new to Zoom, Dr. Danna Young, associate
 professor of communication and of political science at the University 
of Delaware, offers this handy  cheat sheet .)   In  a recent blog , Andrew Gelman ( @StatModeling ),
 a professor of statistics and of political science at Columbia 
University, said he teaches using Zoom for classroom discussion and 
Google Docs for questions about homework and readings. aThe main 
difficulty was that it was mostly me talking,a he noted. aMe talking is 
better than nothing, but I donat think itas the best way for the kids in
 the class to learn.a For future classes, he said he will prepare 
activities ahead of time and pair students to work together in their own
 shared documents.   Luke Stein ( @lukestein ), an assistant professor of finance at Babson College in Massachusetts, offered  detailed suggestions on technologies 
 and setup. Audio, he said, is much more important than video, so 
lecturers need a decent microphone. The built-in webcam on most laptops 
will suffice, but faculty should elevate it to get a decent angle. And 
if they want to incorporate student interaction, they should consider 
involving a teaching assistant who can monitor questions on a separate 
computer.   If your geeky AV-club dreams didnat all come true back in high school, let me recommenda| teaching online  pic.twitter.com/y4cATmS0C3    a aLuke Steina (@lukestein)  February 10, 2020    Paul Musgrave ( @profmusgrave ),

federal government firmly advised them on Wednesday that auniversity and
 higher education should continue at this time with risk mitigation 
measuresa.   The sector already faces a massive financial hit, with 
analysis in the very early stages of Covid-19 suggesting the top 10 
universities would lose $1.2bn due to Chinese student travel bans alone.
 The situation has prompted serious concerns for the future of casual 
academic staff.   A host of universities a the  University of Queensland ,  University of Melbourne ,  University of Adelaide ,  University of Wollongong  and  University of Technology Sydney ,
 among others a are rushing to transition their courses online. The 
Australian National University is pausing its teaching for a week from 
Monday and says it is astopping face-to-face teaching for lectures and 
moving to remote participationa.   The UQ vice-chancellor, Peter 
HA,j, told students in an email late on Sunday that it would temporarily 
cancel all coursework after a fourth confirmed case on the campus.   aThis is a big call, and not one I have taken lightly,a HA,j wrote to students.   The University of Sydney and  Southern Cross University  have each committed to delivering all of their classes remotely from Monday.   But
 others are pressing on with some form of face-to-face teaching of 
lectures and other classes, albeit with risk mitigation measures, 
including  Monash University .   The  University of Western Australia 
 says on its website that it is continuing to aoperate as normal and our
 academic calendar is unchangeda. It also announced it is moving all 
lectures and tutorials and, where possible, practical classes to online 
delivery mode until further notice from Monday.   The approach to 
staff leave has also been disjointed. Some universities are providing 
affected staff with special coronavirus leave, others are telling staff 
to use their existing personal and annual leave.   At the University
 of Sydney, Nick Riemer, a senior lecturer in English and linguistics, 
said teaching staff had found themselves rushing to prepare for online 
classes while also juggling the concerns of students. He said there was 
awidespread concerna across campus about the implications of the virus 
for teaching and professional staff long-term.   aIt has been fairly chaotic and there are all these intense extra demands being placed on staff,a he said.   aThis
 semester I have less than 80 students and there is still a quite 
significant extra time burden placed on my work [but] colleagues who are
 running much larger lecture programs have reported exponentially higher
 workload.a   Riemer also said he was concerned that aemergency 
measuresa put in place during the crisis a including extra working from 
home demands a would become anormaliseda, as well as fears for 
professional and casual staff at the university.   aThereas an enormous amount of concern about the implications for the amount of work available for those staff,a he said.   The response of the University of the Sunshine Coast, which had to  conduct deep cleaning 
 following a visit from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, two 
weeks ago, has prompted a particularly angry response from staff.   The
 university on Friday announced it would pause coursework teaching and 
assessments for a week from Monday, to give it time to redesign its 
courses to support online delivery and social distancing.   But 
earlier in the week, it told staff to reverse plans they had already 
developed to deliver the vast majority of their courses online.   On
 Wednesday, senior leadership at the university wrote to the school and 
ordered it to retract the plans and return to face-to-face teaching, 
citing the advice of the federal government.   The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) described the decision as anutsa and deeply irresponsible.   aFor
 the University of the Sunshine Coast to say we were ready to have 
online delivery for some of our subjects but actually weare going to 
return to our normal timetabled operations, that is just nuts,a the 
unionas Queensland secretary, Michael McNally, told the Guardian.   aThereas
 no reason for that. Many universities are actively trying to put their 
stuff online, for the simple reason that even if universities arenat 
closed, it reduces the risk to the community to deliver as much of the 
teaching as possible online.a   It also appears to run  counter to the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee , which on Wednesday said it supported universities using as much online teaching as possible.   aGiven
 the demonstrated feasibility of online delivery of lecture content, we 
support universities and higher education centres moving to an online 
platform, where appropriate, for continuity of student education,a the 
committee said.   The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, advised universities to use acommon sensea as they continue operations.   aI
 would expect and trust that universities, that while theyare exempt, 
are nevertheless applying some common sense in minimising any 
unnecessary gatherings of large numbers of people, whether itas less 
than 100 or more than 100,a Bowen told the ABC.   The University of 
the Sunshine Coast did not respond directly to the NTEUas criticism. But
 a spokesman said the university was aworking towards what is expected 
to be a government directive to suspend face-to-face teaching in the 
near futurea.   aMuch planning and work in recent weeks have gone 
into preparing the university for the delivery of online learning across
 all disciplines,a he said.   The university has cancelled 
graduations, is encouraging students to study online where possible, and
 is advising social distancing in other face-to-face classes.   Universities
 Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, acknowledged that the 
tertiary sectoras response to the virus had varied, but said all 
universities were adhering to advice from officials and praised the 
federal government for providing a aclear set of requirementsa.   aThese
 are prudent, measured steps designed to safeguard students, staff and 
their communities. At the same time, we are trying to minimise 
disruption to studentsa education,a she said.   aThings are moving very quickly, and all universities have mobilised staff and students in what is a national effort.   aNone
 of this is easy and we recognise the challenges faced by our students 
and staff. But it is vital that as individuals and institutions we work 
together to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus and protect the 
community. Peopleas lives depend on how we respond now.a  "

Mr
 Morrison on Wednesday vowed not to close schools and also intervened 
this week to ensure 600 Catholic schools in New South Wales stayed open.   However,
 expert opinion on the issue is divided and senior University of Sydney 
health professor Claire Hooker claims it's perfectly reasonable for 
parents to take their children out of school.    'Some will feel especially concerned to protect vulnerable family members,' Dr Hooker told  ABC News .     Scroll down for video     Schoolchildren are pictured in uniform outside Strathfield South Public School in Sydney on Friday   Three women wearing face masks use their mobile phones during a work break in Neutral Bay on March 18   'Their
 decisions are reasonable and valid; many people prefer more 
conservative strategies while the evidence is uncertain and 
conflicting.'   The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee
 has said pre-emptive closures of schools are not proportionate with the
 spread of the coronavirus.    But Dr Hooker pointed to 
research by Imperial College London which suggested school and 
university closures could stem the pandemic.   Pictured: 
University of Sydney health professor Claire Hooker. She said it was 
reasonable for parents to want to withdraw their children from school 
due to the coronavirus   Dr Hooker said teachers' concerns 
about the spread of coronavirus were also valid and many feel like they 
are being treated as an 'expendable resource'.    'While at 
present the risk to teachers in Australia is low, it is also reasonable 
that teachers feel concerned right now. Teachers may feel more able to 
manage hygiene practices at school with a smaller staff-student ratio,' 
she said.    There is not a consensus among academics about 
whether children should be taken out of schools and many disagree with 
Dr Hooker's views.     Professor Allen Cheng from Monash 
University, who is an expert in infectious diseases, said children 
should be taken out of school if they are sick.   There have been 756 infections in Australia and seven deaths since the coronavirus outbreak began   But he added he doubted his ability to give his children the same quality of education their teachers can provide.   Professor
 of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at Australian National 
University Peter Collignon added there was always a risk of infection 
whether children went to school or not.    Those under the age of 40 have a low risk of death from the disease, Professor Collignon said.    Lecturer
 Paul Kidson, a lecturer in educational leadership at the University of 
Wollongong, meanwhile argued parents should think carefully about 
pulling their children out of school.   Professor Kidson said age 
was an important factor and secondary school students might suffer more 
in their education from being withdrawn than younger pupils.     It comes as the United Kingdom closed schools, colleges and nurseries until further notice.    Only children of 'keyworkers' like health service staff will continue to go to school beyond Friday.   The number of COVID-19 cases in the UK sits at more than 3,200 - more than four times the 756 infections in Australia.      Advertisement    "

 hope everyone is staying safe during this COVID-19 pandemic. If you're 
looking for things to read with sports essentially shut down, our own 
Thor Nystrom has his  RB rankings for the 2020 NFL Draft , and Derrik Klassen looks at some of the  narratives for the draft class , and if there's any merit to them.    On to the week's news.   The
 story of last week was several schools announcing cancellation of 
spring events due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This week, the story was 
more of the same, but on a larger scale.   The
 Pac-12, SEC, ACC, Big 12, AAC and several more schools and conferences 
announced that they were cancelling or postponing all spring 
events as well as their spring games due to the virus. It's obviously 
not a big surprise because of what's going on right now, but it just 
illustrates how much things have amplified in the last few 
weeks. Some conferences like the Big Ten have just canceled through
 the middle of April, but at this point, it sure seems like this is just
 delaying the inevitable.    The
 loss here -- other than a sense of normalcy for sports fans -- for 
programs is really for those schools who have early enrollees (everyone)
 and those that are looking to break in a new quarterback this spring 
(several). Those practices are not going to be made up barring something
 unforeseen, it appears, and assuming the season does start on time, 
it's entirely possible that we'll see some rustiness/poor quarterback 
play early on -- more so than usual, anyway. There are obviously much 
bigger things going on than this, but it's the reality of the situation.    Heather Marini 
 made history on Monday, being named the first woman to hold a position 
coach title in the FCS after she was named the quarterback coach of 
Brown.   Marini
 spent last year as an offensive quality coach for the Bears in 2019. 
Prior to that, she was a scouting assistant for the New York Jets.   Marini,
 a native of Australia, also played competitively for the Gridiron 
Victoria Women's team, and she was also a quarterbacks coach/coaching 
development assistant for Monash University. She'll have a chance to 
work with one of the best quarterbacks in the Ivy League in  E.J. Perry , who threw for 22 touchdowns in 2019 for Brown.    It's
 very, very early in the 2021 recruiting cycle, but assuming you give a 
semblance of a care about these things, you have to be impressed with 
what Ohio State is doing.   The Buckeyes added three more four-star recruits this week; cornerback  Jakailin Johnson , safety  Andre Turrentine  and running back  Evan Pryor . With those two additions and the pledge of  Devonta Smith 
 earlier in March, that gives Ohio State 12 of the top 300 recruits
 on ESPN's list. The only schools that come close to that are Clemson 
with ten and Florida than nine, and no other school has more than five. 
There weren't a lot of doubts that  Ryan Day  was capable of handling the job after  Urban Meyer  retired, but if anyone had any questions about his ability to recruit, they should be answered by now.    Ohio State wasn't the only school who added four-star talents this week. Oregon received a verbal commitment from  Ty Thompson ,
 a 6-foot-4, 200-pound quarterback who is rated the eighth best 
pro-style quarterback by 247Sports and third best prospect out of the 
state of Arizona (Mesquite HS, Gilbert). The Tar Heels continue to 
impress, and added four-star athlete  Deandre Boykins 
 from Central Cabarrus HS in Concord, North Carolina. The 5-foot-11, 
200-pound Boykins is capable of playing on both sides of the ball, and 
it'll be interesting to see where UNC deploys him in 2001.   It would be fair to say that  Dan Mullen 's time in Florida has been successful so far, and unsurprisingly, the Gators want to keep the 47-year-old in Gainesville.   Multiple
 outlets are reporting that Florida and Mullen are working on a contract
 extension. In his two years at the program, the former Mississippi 
State coach has gone 21-5 with the Gators, with an 11-5 record in the 
SEC. He made $6.07 million in 2019, which is the 10th highest figure 
among all coaches at public institutions. It's just fifth highest in the
 SEC, however, and it's likely that Mullen will be bumped into the top 
three -- assuming this extension gets done, of course. There are three 
years left on the original six-year deal he signed after he left 
Mississippi State.

 Heather Marini has been appointed quarterback coach at America's Brown 
University, becoming the first female to do so in US College football 
history.   The 31-year-old, who grew up playing netball and tennis 
in Victoria's Goulburn Valley, is the first women's position coach in 
American Division I football.   Marini was dragged to a Monash 
University gridiron game 12 years ago to watch her future husband play 
which kick-started her amazing journey.   No other Australian has achieved the feat.   ""People
 respect the fact I have come across the world to follow a passion of 
mine and therefore they are like, 'This girl is kind of crazy already so
 let's give her a chance to see what she can do',"" Marini told AAP on 
Sunday from her home in Providence, Rhode Island.   ""If you can 
prove yourself by working hard then they are going to give you another 
opportunity which is what happened here at Brown.""   Marini, as quarterback coach, will oversee the most important position on an American football team.   Brown's star quarterback EJ Perry led the nation and set an Ivy League record for total offence in 2019.   Marini held the title of offensive quality control last season.   ""Heather has earned the coaching position,"" Brown head coach James Perry said.   ""In one season with our program, Heather has done a great job for us.   ""She
 has proven through her efforts in the office every day with us in an 
off-the-field role that she's ready to run the quarterback room.""   Marini
 was not initially impressed with American football while watching 
future husband, Kieren Marini, play for the Monash Warriors back in the 
early days.   As their relationship blossomed Marini, who was 
studying for a degree in exercise and sports science and majoring in 
coaching, agreed to be the team's unofficial sports trainer.   She 
then became strength and conditioning coach and eventually flew to the 
US to take up a strength and conditioning internship at Oregon State 
University.   When Marini returned to Monash she offered her services whenever the Warriors needed it.   ""If
 the running back coach wasn't there that day I coached running back and
 over 10 years I coached every offensive position,"" she said.   ""When
 the club decided they would have a women's team the coach sent me a 
text each day saying, 'No, you're not going to coach you're going to 
play quarterback for us'.""   When Kieren Marini moved to the US in 
2017 to advance his career as a cancer researcher at the University of 
California, San Francisco, Marini pursued football coaching 
opportunities.   She attended the NFL Women's Careers in Football Forum and met future Brown head coach Perry.   In
 2018 she earned a professional scouting fellowship with the NFL's New 
York Jets and a few months later Perry hired Marini to the offensive 
quality control position.   Marini said the key to her success is not being shy.   She
 asked football programs across the US, including Stanford, UC Berkley 
and UC Davis, if she could shadow their coaching staff.   ""The coaches were open and wonderful,"" she said.   Marini's Australian accent does cause a little confusion.   ""The thing with the accent is when you say over here 'I coach football' they say 'Oh, you coach rugby',"" Marini said.   ""I laugh and say, 'No, not that either. I'm from Melbourne where football is Australian rules'.""     Advertisement    "

Sign up  for the Supply Lines newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Economics on  Twitter  for more.     Across
 North America and Europe, lockdowns of entire communities and countries
 are underway. Borders are closing to travel even as governments insist 
that     cargo and trade 
 will still be allowed to pass. That may be a moot point. Economies 
running into a brick wall tend to see collapses in trade. We learned 
that in 2009.   The evidence so far this year from Asian economies like 
China, Japan and South Korea that were hit earlier than western ones is 
that the coronavirus crisis and the resulting shutting down of industry 
will have a     severe impact  on trade no matter what the politicians say.   But what if governments took the next step and decided to 
halt trade altogether as part of their efforts to slow the spread the 
Covid-19 virus? What would be the economic impact then?   In a conversation with the Dartmouth College economic 
historian Douglas Irwin last week, he remembered that work by economists
 had been done on exactly that. Because thereas an example in U.S. 
economic history Irwin has spent some time looking at it as well. (Irwin
 followed our conversation up with     on Twitter over the weekend.)   At
 the request of the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Homeland 
Security, a group of economists at Australiaas Monash University in 2012
 modeled what the economic impact would be of a     of the U.S. border to cargo and people in the event of a public health threat like a pandemic.   They
 considered various scenarios, the most extreme of which called for the 
trade in 95% of goods to be suspended for 12 months. The impact on the 
U.S. economy? A fall in real gross domestic product of 48%.   There
 are, of course, fans of greater trade restrictions who would dispute 
that finding. There is also an example in American history a albeit one 
long before the days of global supply chains a to draw on that points to
 a milder though significant impact.   In December 1807 the U.S. 
Congress at President Thomas Jeffersonas urging imposed an embargo on 
trade to protest British and French naval harassment that lasted until 
March 1809.   In a   2005 paper ,
 Irwin calculated that the embargo cost the U.S. 5% of its gross 
national product at the time. But it also became as close to a natural 
experiment in autarky as the U.S. has ever experienced in peacetime.   As Irwin lays out, the value of U.S. goods exports fell from from  $49 million  in 1807 to  $9 million  in 1808. Meanwhile, the value of imports fell from  $85 million  in 1807 to  $45 million  in 1808 a a decline of nearly 50 percent.   Weare
 not there yet. Except for international travel, the shutdown underway 
in the U.S. and European economies now is largely domestic. Any effect 
on trade we are likely to see is a secondary effect of economies closing
 down temporarily rather than the borders being closed to cargo.   That doesnat mean, though, that in an age of rising 
protectionism and populist economic nationalism with a pandemic rattling
 the world the economic costs couldnat soar even further.        Early South Korea trade figures for March showed  surprising resilience 
 in exports before the full brunt of the coronavirus hit. 
Shipment during the first 20 days of the month rose 10% from a year
 earlier, the Korea Customs Service said Monday. The period had an extra
 1.5 working days in the period compared with 2019. Without that, the 
result would have been just about flat.      Donat keep it to yourself.   Colleagues and friends can  sign up here .

 Mr Morrison has suggested the country could move to 'stage two' 
restrictions next month - which would surely devastate further industrie   When
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the shutdown of pubs, clubs, 
gyms and other businesses this week, he warned that the measures were 
just the beginning.         'This is stage one of this response,' Mr Morrison said, adding it will be reviewed each month.    Restrictions on everything from the number of people in supermarkets to  if  you can walk outside and whether schools, public transport, parks and 'non-essential' businesses will close could follow.    Daily Mail Australia has been told the government will only push ahead with even more draconian 'stage two' restrictions if  coronavirus  transmissions in the community continue to escalate or Australians fail to 'socially distance'.    Stage
 Two would almost certainly see the forced closure of 'non-essential' 
businesses and other restrictions, although the Federal government is 
keeping mum on just what exactly those will be.    Cases increased by a record number again on Monday, hitting 1,709, with seven dead.   For
 an insight into what the nation could expect next, here's a summary of 
how other cities and nations have handled COVID-19 lockdowns.    WUHAN,
 CHINA: Above is life in state-enforced quarantine in the capital of 
China's Hubei province, where the coronavirus COVID-19 is believed to 
have originated   BANGKOK, THAILAND: Workers in sci-fi style gear rest after dousing the streets in disinfectant   DESIO, ITALY: Shoppers 'social distance' outside a supermarket with locals each keeping more than a trolley-length apart   A
 senior government source said Australia's shutdown stages will look 
similar to those unveiled by Kiwi PM Jacinda Ardern's, but with crucial 
differences.    Ms Ardern announced her four-stage program on 
Monday and will take the country to its most extreme stage for four 
weeks starting this Wednesday.     All New Zealanders who don't work in essential services will be told to stay home. Schools and universities will be shut.    Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, with her four stage shutdown plan   New South Wales: 2,182   Victoria: 968   Queensland: 781   Western Australia: 364   South Australia: 337   Australian Capital Territory: 84   Tasmania: 69   Northern Territory: 19    TOTAL CASES:  4,804     RECOVERED: 355     DEAD: 20      People will only be able to catch public transport for medical reasons or if they work 'essential' jobs.   If you want to get some fresh air and go for a walk or a jog, you will have to do it on your own.    The
 government has been granted sweeping powers to lock people at home. The
 military will be called in to enforce the rules.    Essential 
services such as supermarkets, pharmacies and medical centres will stay 
open. But supplies could be rationed.     
 Italy's death toll is now higher than China's at more than 5,400 people
 and the prime minister announced increasingly severe measures on 
Sunday.   The country has enforced a strict lockdown on cities for 
weeks, with police squads reportedly charging as many as 40,000 citizens
 with flouting the rules.    Shoppers are forced to wait in 'socially distanced' queues just to go to the supermarket.    TURIN,
 ITALY: A train station stands almost totally vacant as police and 
soldiers enforce a desperate lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19   An Italian priest adjusts selfies sent by his congregation, which he has glued to chairs, to celebrate Sunday mass in Giussano   Citizens are only allowed to move about town for 'non-deferrable and proven business and health reasons'.    Parks and beaches are shut.    Joggers have been told to stick to running around the block, or close to their home.     But the government has only recently announced the closure of non-essential businesses and industries.    The poverty-stricken South American nation has shut its borders and the streets have been taken over by the military.    LIMA, PERU: Soldiers on the streets during the first night of curfew in the nation's capital   Trapped
 Australian tourists have described mhelicopters buzzing overhead and 
soldiers walking the streets, and a strict night-time curfew enforced.   There
 are oppressive restrictions on what tourists can do - not much, other 
than walk to the shops - amid growing community anger at the virus being
 brought into the country.     The 
epicentre of the coronavirus and capital of the disease-ravaged Hubei 
province has suffered through the strictest lockdown the world has seen.   COVID-19
 is thought to have originated in 'wet markets' where live animals, such
 as bats and pangolins, are sold to be eaten.     Most of 
the city's 11 million residents were banned from leaving their homes 
except to get essential supplies or receive medical attention.   WUHAN, CHINA: A man eats his noodles in his residential compound - unable to leave unless going to shop for essentials   A resident checks his laundry on his building terrace during lockdown in Wuhan   Authorities stormed house after house, searching for people who were infected by the virus.   No journeys were allowed outside the city except for compelling medical or humanitarian reasons.   Children were banned from school - or even playing outside.    A 'sudden avalanche' of  coronavirus 
 cases would overwhelm Australia's health system and force doctors to 
leave older people to die, top medics have told Daily Mail Australia.   Australia is 'only weeks' behind  Italy 
 where cities have been sealed off and wards are so crammed doctors have
 called for a maximum age limit to prioritise care.     If
 the crisis in Australia gets dramatically worse, there is a 'serious 
risk' the country will run out of intensive care beds, said Paul 
Komesaroff, Professor of Medicine at Monash University.   Intensive
 care wards may need to stop treating older patients and instead focus 
on those who have longer to live and better chances of survival. 
Pictured: An Italian ICU ward in Cremona   That would mean 
intensive care units (ICUs) would only let in patients who have the 
highest chance of recovering - usually young, fit and otherwise healthy 
people.   Those who are too old and don't have a high likelihood of recovery will be left to die.    People who are already under intensive care could be moved to make way for others considered more deserving.     On
 Thursday NSW Chief Medical Officer Dr Kerry Chant estimated that 20 per
 cent of the population - around 5million Australians - would get 
coronavirus.    A coronavirus emergency checkpoint and triage point at Civile Hospital in Brescia, Italy   That
 means around half a million Australians may need intensive care, based 
on statistics from Italy which show 10 per cent of patients were sent to
 ICUs.   Australia currently has around 2,500 ICU beds, only enough to cover 0.01 per cent of the population at once.    'There
 are limited facilities in the high-tech areas such as intensive care

Daily Mail Australia.    'There is a very serious possibility a sudden increase in people requiring ventilation would overwhelm the system.'   "

The
 federal government is trying to rush through emergency regulation 
banning dentists from hoarding Hydroxychloroquine, also known as 
Plaquenil.   Stockpiling of the drug, which is used to treat 
rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, has led to 
shortages of the drug for people who really need it.     Dentists
 are prescribing themselves and their family an anti-arthritis drug 
because it is rumoured to protect against coronavirus (stock)   The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia is urging dentists to only prescribe the drug for arthritis and malaria.     Any dentist found to mis-prescribing the medication would have to answer to the Australian Dental Board.   New South Wales: 2,182   Victoria: 968   Queensland: 781   Western Australia: 364   South Australia: 337   Australian Capital Territory: 84   Tasmania: 69   Northern Territory: 19    TOTAL CASES:  4,804     RECOVERED: 355     DEAD: 20      Professor
 Eric Morand, head of rheumatology at Monash Health said there has been a
 massive blow to the drug due to shortages.    'We already have
 patients who need this drug for other diseases who are having trouble 
getting this drug because someone has persuaded doctors to give it to 
them a that's in Australia and around the world,' he told  The Age .   'I
 urge people not to go and find this drug, because they will be taking 
it out of the hands of other people who need it. This is just like 
panic-buying. It is a selfish act, don't do it.'   There's no 
confirmation that the drug actually protects against the killer 
virus  as President Donald Trump tweeted earlier this week that the
 drug could help with the coronavirus cases around the world.    'Hydroxychloroquine
 and Azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the 
biggest game changers in the history of medicine,' he tweeted on 
Sunday.    'The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH be put in use immediately.     'People are dying, move fast and God bless everyone!'   The Australian government rushed to pass regulations on Monday to ban dentists from prescribing the drug (stock)   Pharmaceutical
 Society of Australia national president Associate Professor Chris 
Freeman confirmed that pharmacies were seeing an increase in demand for 
the drug.    '[We are] receiving reports from Australian 
pharmacists that they are receiving prescriptions from: doctors 
prescribing for other doctors and their families; as well as dentists 
prescribing to the community and their families; non-medical prescribers
 prescribing bulk amounts of the drug,' an open letter to doctors 
reads.    'Our strong advice to pharmacists at this point in 
time, until further advice is available, is to refuse the dispensing of 
hydroxychloroquine if there is not a genuine need, and that need is for 
those indications for what it is approved for a inflammatory conditions 
or the suppression and treatment of malaria.'   Australia's number of positive coronavirus cases has soared to 1,972 with eight dead.      Advertisement    "

NAB
 was forced to close more than a dozen branches in Victoria on Tuesday 
with more expected to follow suit after the state government brought 
forward the end of term school holidays.   The closures left parents
 across the state, including banking staff, scrambling to make 
arrangements and many were not able to make it into work.   Banks including NAB, the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have been forced to close some branches due to staffing shortages    'Our
 workforce is adjusting with some team members unable to work as a 
result of changes like school and childcare closures,' a spokesman said.   'We're
 aiming to keep as many branches open as possible as we continue to 
provide essential banking services to our customers.     'However,
 we may be required to temporarily close some locations to ensure that 
our people are able to care for their children and dependants.'   NAB is moving its staff from regional towns into busier, metropolitan branches to cope with staff shortages.   Schools in Victoria and the ACT were recently closed as local authorities brought forward the end of term school holidays   Schools have also closed in the ACT, while schools in other states such as New South Wales remain open.    Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison has refused to shut schools across Australia 
but told parents they can keep children at home until the end of term 
one if they wish.   Almost all banks are openly encouraging 
customers to use their dedicated apps or discuss their issues over the 
phone instead of physically coming into branches so social distancing 
can be maintained.   Nab has been forced to compile staff into its venues that attract the most traffic   The Commonwealth Bank said   it was experiencing similar issues and had to close seven of its 900 branches due to staffing issues.   'The
 key issue for us at the moment is working through the numbers of our 
staff who have to take on carers' duties in the event schools are closed
 and children have to be at home,' a spokesperson said.   'Under that scenario it may be necessary for us to close a very small number of branches.'   Westpac told told  Australian Financial Review  it
 previously closed branches based at Monash University and La Trobe
 University but are also expected to shut venues due to staffing issues.   ANZ is also believed to be closing branches but has been able to provide more specific information.    Those looking to see if their local branch is open should contact them directly or check through the bank's website.

 communities worldwide shut down to combat the coronavirus outbreak, the
 tech industry is finding ways to bring people together while 
self-isolating.   Social media has been criticised for spreading 
misinformation about coronavirus, but platforms old and new are 
connecting people across the world and across the road.   Nextdoor 
is an app designed to bring neighbourhoods together and provide a way 
for people to post jobs, safety tips or event information within the 
community.   It is now becoming a way for neighbours to check on each other and provide help during self-isolation.   Members
 have offered to drop off toilet paper, sanitary products and food to 
those in need, with some simply offering virtual company.   Monash 
University student Victoria Vassallo from Melbourne offered to give 
sanitary items to anybody needing them, as toilet paper and other 
products were stripped from shelves.   ""People are finally starting to think less about themselves and more about others,"" Ms Vassallo told AAP.   Local
 communities on traditional social media platforms are also banding 
together to help one another online through groups such as Love Your 
Neighbour Melbourne on Facebook.   The group was set up as Victorians started to feel the impact of the coronavirus and already has nearly 7000 members.   Their work includes volunteering to safely support the community and sharing essential items.   Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp have had increases in traffic as more people go into quarantine.   ""Calling
 has more than doubled for Messenger and WhatsApp year-over-year in 
places most impacted by the virus, like in Italy,"" a statement from 
Facebook said.   The impact of the coronavirus has prompted dating 
app Tinder to drop charges for its Passport feature so users across the 
world can speak, no longer dictated by distance.   ""Tinder's hope 
is that members can use the Passport feature to transport themselves out
 of self-quarantine to anywhere in the world,"" a spokesperson said.   ""They

 coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and 
people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to 
reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses 
are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they
 are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The 
coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this 
outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on
 Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed 
around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 
'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named 
after it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr
 Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a 
family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species 
including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild 
animals.    'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there 
were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of 
these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has 
been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and 
result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).    'Coronaviruses
 are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another 
and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new 
coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet 
known.'     The first human cases were publicly reported 
from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people 
live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on 
December 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had 
been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were 
developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The
 first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 
cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 
people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.      Where does the virus come from?    According
 to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from 
bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the 
similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet 
cats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came 
from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which 
has since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market 
is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being
 sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, 
porcupines and camel meat.    A study by the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific 
journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in 
patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found 
in bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so 
scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a 
middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a 
human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr
 Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not 
involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places 
the origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether
 another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, 
and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host 
might have been.'      So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?     Experts
 say the international community is concerned about the virus because so
 little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It
 is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 
in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus 
which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which
 killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for
 COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any 
immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This 
means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across 
often, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in 
January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel 
viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which
 circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most
 seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 
1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand
 fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate 
could be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.    'My
 feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this 
iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The
 illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, 
making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even
 before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the 
saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, 
kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live
 on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning 
people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,
 people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in 
Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been 
there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to 
person.     What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once
 someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 
days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still
 be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, 
typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever 
(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from 
these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In
 a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those 
with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an 
infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with 
fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left 
untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing 
that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the
 virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to 
flu, but it is not clear why.       What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?         Scientists
 in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of 
the virus and released them to experts working around the world.    This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.      Examinations
 have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known 
as mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,
 the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it 
spread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and 
to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus 
might look different every time scientists analyse it.      More
 study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small 
number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were
 various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed 
separately.    How dangerous is the virus?      The
 virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death 
rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 
50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning
 of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are 
infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded 
cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they 
never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more 
serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it 
really is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr
 Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a 
mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only 
showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be 
accurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured?     The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics
 do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral
 drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then 
developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge 
amounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and 
it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this 
outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National 
Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, 
say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about 
coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But 
this may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,
 governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and
 to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People
 who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their 
symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected 
public.   And airports around the world are putting in place 
screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's 
temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot 
those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,
 it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small 
likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?       The
 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by 
the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new 
disease'.    Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside 
of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't 
actually spreading actively around the world.  "

Businesses including massage parlours and nail salons will be closed and weddings will be limited to five people.    But even before those measures come in, officials will discuss what the next level of restrictions will be.   The
 national cabinet will tonight to debate 'stage three' restrictions 
after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned this morning: 'Stage 
three is coming'.   Nobody knows exactly what the next stage will 
entail - but experts have told Daily Mail Australia that more extreme 
social distancing measures are inevitable.    'Distancing can 
be more extreme and restrictions can be made tougher. Watch this 
space,' said Stephen Leeder, a Professor of Public Health at Sydney
 University.    Prime Minister Scott Morrison 
said that he wants schools to stay open so essential workers do not have
 to worry about childcare and children can continue their education.   He
 said the health risk of keeping schools open was low because young 
people are not vulnerable to coronavirus - but some teachers fear they 
are 'cannon fodder' and want the gates closed for their own 
safety.    Paul Komesaroff, Professor of Medicine at 
Monash University, told Daily Mail Australia that closing the schools 
would be a logical step. Pictured: A teacher sits in an empty classroom 
at a primary school in Melbourne   Paul Komesaroff, Professor 
of Medicine at Monash University, told Daily Mail Australia that closing
 the schools would be a logical step.    'The next thing to do 
is to close schools and universities,' he said. 'But that is a big step 
because it may impact whether parents can go to work.'   In Norway 
and the UK, schools have been kept open for the children of essential 
workers such as doctors and nurses and something similar could be 
arranged in Australia.   Some states are already moving towards closing schools by bringing forward holidays.    Tasmania's school term will end four days early so teachers can prepare online education resources.   Victoria
 has also closed its schools early, sending 1million pupils home three 
days before the Easter break which starts this Friday in the 
state.    Meanwhile, the NSW Teachers Federation is calling for
 a planned transition to online learning across all state schools as 
attendance numbers continue to fall due to coronavirus fears.     On
 Tuesday night, Mr Morrison announced a raft of businesses that would 
need to close their doors, putting thousands of Australians out of work.   Personal
 service businesses 'where there is a lot of contact', such as beauty 
therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons and tattoo parlours will be forced
 to shut.    Personal service businesses 'where there is
 a lot of contact', such as beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons
 and tattoo parlours are being forced to shut   But 
hairdressers and barbershops are allowed to remain open as well as food 
markets and shopping centres, except for the food courts.   These businesses could be in the firing line if the government moves further towards a lock down.    In
 an extreme scenario, only critical businesses such as petrol stations, 
pharmacies and grocery stores would need to remain open.   Restaurants,
 cafes and food courts will be restricted to takeaway service only. 
Pictured: An empty dining area in the once busy strip of restaurants 
Barangaroo    Mr Morrison announced on Tuesday that social sports such as large groups of people playing soccer in a park have been banned.   But he said that boot camps and personal training will be allowed to go ahead with less then 10 people.    Yoga
 and barre sessions, as well as spinning and other exercise sessions, 
can continue so long as they abide by the 10 people or fewer rule as 
well.     Gym goers are training outside after 
fitness clubs and recreation centres were force to shut under new 
coronavirus health measures. Professor Komesaroff said Australia 
could eventually follow the lead of other countries and ban all exercise
 outside the home   Yoga and barre sessions, as well as
 spinning and other exercise sessions, can continue so long as they 
abide by the 10 people or fewer rule as well   These types of exercise classes could be next on the chopping block.   Professor Komesaroff said Australia could eventually follow the lead of other countries and ban group exercise outside the home.   'We
 could see rules where you are only allowed out of your home for a run. 
Or maybe we won't even be allowed out as in China.'    He 
added: 'I personally can't see a problem with some-one running on the 
street alone because there's no risk of transmission if they are not in a
 group.'    Grocery shops will always stay open because people need to buy food.    But there could be limits imposed on the number of people allowed in a supermarket at one time.   Shops
 could also require customers to better observe social distancing by 
limiting the number of people in aisles and making them stand two metres
 apart.     Supermarkets will be among the few 
businesses that will remain open during the social distancing period. 
Woolworths has since installed protective screens to minimise 
human-to-human contact    Shops could also require
 customers to better observe social distancing by limiting the number of
 people in aisles and making them stand two metres apart   In Italy, for example, shoppers are forced to wait in 'socially distanced' queues just to go to the supermarket.    'Supermarkets need to have social distancing,' Professor Komesaroff said.    'They
 might limit the number of people and have them two metres apart when 
they queue. That kind of process is inevitable,' he said.   Weddings have been limited to five people and funerals to ten people.    But
 in the UK weddings have been banned altogether and gatherings of more 
than two people, except in the family home, are barred.   There is scope for Australia to further restrict the number of people that can gather at one time.    Under
 the tight new restrictions, weddings could go ahead with only five 
people present, including the couple and celebrant    Registered
 and licensed clubs and bars have been forced to shut. The government 
has also advised against large outdoor gatherings and house 
parties     Professor Komesaroff said such measures would help slow the spread of the coronavirus.   'We're
 right at the start of a catastrophic upsurge and we know that the 
infection numbers will increase drastically,' he warned.   'The minute the health service overwhelms, the death rate will increase dramatically. I don't think we can be overconfident.'   He
 said a requirement for people to show police a letter explaining why 
they have left home would likely be considered in the final stage of 
measures - not in stage three.       The government is looking to limit interactions between groups, particularly any event or gathering with 10 or more people.   The new restrictions, from 11.59pm on March 25, mean:       BUSINESS    * Food courts in shopping centres will only be available for takeaway food. No sitting.   * Auction houses will shut. Auctions and open house inspections are banned.   * Outdoor and indoor markets are banned while rules around major food markets will be addressed by states and territories.   *

 through the corona confusion: Your guide to what the new rules on life 
in Australia during the COVID-19 crisis REALLY MEAN        BY KAREN RUIZ FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA        WHAT ARE THE NEW RULES?     The
 general rule and health advice for all Australians is to practice 
social distancing by limiting activities that involve a high degree of 
social interaction - or to just stay at home.     New social distancing guidelines will limit what Australians can and cannot do for the next six months      WHY HAVE THESE MEASURES BEEN IMPLEMENTED?     Social
 distancing is the only guaranteed way to prevent further spread of 
COVID-19. The less face-to-face contact with others, the less there is a
 chance someone carrying the virus can transmit it to someone 
else.     WHEN CAN I LEAVE THE HOUSE?     There
 are exceptions for social distancing and that includes: shopping for 
necessities, medical needs, assisting vulnerable people, exercising 
(alone or with members of your household only) and going to work (if you
 cannot work from home).     If you are sick, you should 
not be leaving your home and should stay inside until you are recovered -
 unless medical attention is required.       GROCERY SHOPPING OR BUYING NECESSITIES       CAN I GO SHOPPING  ?    You
 can go shopping at businesses that remain open, but the general advice 
is to limit outings as much as possible and only step out to buy 
necessities.     WHAT SHOPS REMAIN OPEN?     Supermarkets, grocery stores, bottle shops, medical centres, hospitals and pharmacies remain open.     WHAT ABOUT RESTAURANTS OR CAFES?     You
 can no longer dine in restaurants as eating in an indoor space with 
large groups of people violates social distancing guidelines.     CAN I ORDER TAKEAWAY?     You
 can still order takeaway at restaurants, cafes and food courts. Online 
delivery services such as Uber Eats have also implemented 'no contact' 
services to limit physical contact.     WHAT ABOUT SALONS OR BEAUTY PARLOURS?    Hairdressers
 and barbers can continue but must strictly manage social distancing and
 restrict the amount of time a patron can be in the premises to no more 
than 30 minutes.     Nail, tanning, waxing, and beauty 
salons and tattoo parlours - or services where there is 'a lot of 
contact' - have been closed.      EXERCISE      CAN I STILL WORKOUT AT THE GYM?     No.
 Gyms, health clubs, recreation centres and  swimming pools, are 
among those facilities which have been ordered to close to comply with 
social distancing guidelines.    Boot camps and personal training must be limited to 10 people and enforce social distancing.   Yoga,
 Barre and other group fitness classes may continue as long as they 
abide by the 10 people or fewer rule and social distance 
guidelines.      WHAT ABOUT OUTDOOR EXERCISE?     You
 can still leave your home to go for a walk or to exercise outside, but 
you should only be doing so alone, or with members of your 
household. You should not  be exercising or engaging in sports
 with large groups of people.       MEDICAL NEEDS      WHAT IF I NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR OR MEDICAL CENTRE?      These
 places will remain open and you should seek medical attention if 
needed. However, if you are sick, or have tested positive for COVID-19, 
you should not go to the pharmacy and should ask others for help in 
getting what you need.    EVERYDAY LIFE       SHOULD I GO TO WORK?       It
 is recommended that people who have the option of working from home 
should do so. If there is no working from home plan in place, you should
 go to work as usual, but practice social distancing at the 
workplace.     CAN I HAVE GUESTS OVER?         You
 should aim to limit all physical contact with people outside of your 
household. Hosting friends, visitors or social gatherings at home is not
 recommended.      CAN I STILL GO TO MY FRIENDS' OR PARTNER'S HOUSE?    
 If you would like to keep in touch with friends, colleagues or 
relatives who live outside your household, the recommended advice is to 
use video chat or phone call and avoid physical contact with them.     WHAT ABOUT BIRTHDAY PARTIES/CELEBRATIONS?     Unfortunately,
 under new restrictions large parties and gatherings cannot carry on. 
That includes weddings, which have been restricted to five people, and 
funerals, which have a limit of 10 people or fewer.     Hosting parties or social gatherings inside your home or in outdoor spaces is prohibited.    SHOULD I SEND MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL?     Primary
 schools and high schools remain open.  Prime Minister Scott 
Morrison says it still safe to send your children to school.    CAN I GET IN TROUBLE FOR NOT FOLLOWING RULES?     Yes. Penalties and fines for violating social distancing rules will vary from state to state.     In
 NSW, police officers will have the power to hand out fines of $1,000 to
 individuals and $5,000 to businesses that breach public health orders 
or ministerial directions, beginning on Thursday.     Police
 have the power to apply penalties already in place under the Public 
Health Act, which means people can be jailed for six months and/or 
issued a fine of up to $11,000 if convicted.    Prime Minister 
Scott Morrison said state authorities will also consider putting 
measures in place that could potentially lead to penalties for those who
 organise large gatherings in their homes.   "

 internet quality is still relatively stable in Europe and North 
America, Dr Raschky claims that regions affected by the virus like Italy
 or Spain have shown signs of strain.   Across Australia's major cities, the internet is holding up.   But areas like the ACT, South Australia and Victoria are showing initial signs of pressure.   ""The signs for now in Australia are 'steady', but not entirely reassuring,"" Dr Raschky said.   ""We
 will keep monitoring the situation and plan to provide further reports 
as the Australian social distancing measures ramp up in the coming 
days.""   Broadband provider Optus announced it would support 
customers boosting additional data, and making all fixed broadband plans

        Soldiers helping to build the Nightingale hospital in London 
last night compared the coronavirus crisis to the Battle of the Somme 
(bottom-right and inset, soldiers help with construction). Colonel 
Ashleigh Boreham, who has carried out two tours of Iraq and one of 
Afghanistan, said it was the biggest mission of his career. As 
commanding officer of 256 City of London Field Hospital, he is in charge
 of military personnel working on the NHS facility at the ExCeL centre. 
Built in around ten days, it will have 4,000 beds for coronavirus 
patients when it opens this week (left, the hospital pictured from above
 inside). Similar hospitals are being installed in Manchester, 
Birmingham and Glasgow to ease pressure on existing sites. Up to 200 
soldiers a day have been helping in the construction of the Docklands 
hospital. They are carrying out medical planning, logistics, engineering
 and tasks such as building beds, laying floors, and carrying out 
electrics and plumbing. More than 16,000 members of staff could be 
needed to run the temporary hospital if it reaches its near 4,000-bed 
capacity. It will be split into more than 80 wards containing 42 beds 
each. The facility will be used to treat Covid-19 patients transferred 
from intensive care units across London (top-right, a bed prepared for 
use in the temporary hospital).
          
 
    
            
            Matt Hancock intervened to end the embarrassing situation in
 which the number of tests carried out is short of capacity. The Health 
Secretary has scrapped a rule that 85 per cent of tests were reserved 
for patients, regardless of how many needed testing. It came after 
pictures surfaced of the Chessington drive-thru swabbing site for NHS 
was pictured deserted (left) as staff stretched in the car park 
(bottom-right) and sat on bollards with little to do. Ministers are 
under pressure to get a grip on the testing situation to fight the 
Covid-19 pandemic, with Boris Johnson said to be taking control of 
obtaining the chemicals required (top-right, a test centre open at Ikea

Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire (left). Ministers have been accused
 of sending 'mixed messages' in attempts to encourage the public to 
alter their routines in the face of the devastating pandemic. A 
record-breaking 381 coronavirus deaths and 3,009 cases were declared in 
the UK today, which is Britain's darkest day so far. Yet two women had

 the 6th of February and the dividend was rightfully paid to all

 of the cases involving the Bondi backpackers came from two parties at 
the Boogie Wonderland at the Bucket List Bondi on March 15, and a party 
at Club 77 on the same date.   The new cases in tourists came a day 
after Scott Morrison was forced to close the iconic beach when thousands
 of sunseekers ignored social distancing measures.    Chief 
health officer Dr Kerry Chant on Thursday morning said an additional 190
 people had tested positive in NSW since 8pm on Wednesday.     A cruise ship passenger has died from coronavirus, taking Australia's death toll to 13.   The man in his 70s died in Joondalup Hospital in Perth on Thursday.   It
 was initially reported that he had been on board the Ruby Princess 
cruise ship that docked in Sydney, however Daily Mail Australia 
understands that is not the case.   A cruise ship passenger has died from coronavirus, taking Australia's death toll to 13    He
 is the third passenger on board the ship to die of coronavirus, after a
 woman in her 70s passed away on Tuesday and a man in his 60s died on 
Wednesday.    The man is the second Australian to die from coronavirus in Western Australia.    NSW
 Premier Gladys Berejiklian praised people for 'stepping up and 
following the various decision we have had to take in the last few days 
regarding shutdowns'.   'But I do also want to say to the community 
that if we don't see things shifting in the numbers because of those 
actions, NSW will have to go further,' she said.    'NSW is 
different to the other states. If I feel the curve is not going the way 
we want it to, I will go further in NSW, there will be further 
shutdowns.'    Dr Chant said she was expecting the state's 
number of infections to continue rising due to Australians returning 
from overseas.    'We'll be particularly looking at those cases
 where we don't find any links to either overseas travel or known 
clusters or other confirmed cases,' she said.   'And that will give us an indication of the success of the strategies.'   Meanwhile
 three people in their 70s have died from COVID-19 in Victoria, as the 
state's total number of confirmed cases has also risen to 520.    Another man in his 70s has died in Western Australia from the disease.     Their deaths comes after a 68-year-old cruise ship passenger died from COVID-19 on Wednesday.   Several
 backpackers based in Bondi, in Sydney's east, tested positive to 
COVID-19 between Friday and Sunday. Pictured: thousands ignoring social 
distancing on Bondi Beach last Friday   Garry Kirstenfeldt was on board a Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas that docked in Sydney on March 18.

Queensland
 Health confirmed the man's death on Wednesday evening and said he had 
'serious underlying medical condition before contracting the 
virus.'     Ms Berejiklian said police will be ramping up their presence around Sydney's ports as well as in regional and rural areas.   'Nobody
 will be getting off a ship until further notice. I don't want any 
action taken releasing passengers off boats in Sydney until all 
authorities have ticked it off,' she said on Thursday morning.   'We
 are telling people not to be overly concerned or panicked but just to 
know that the NSW government will go further if we have to because it is
 in the interests of public safety.'   Garry Kirstenfeldt, 
68, died from COVID-19 on Wednesday. He was on board a Royal Caribbean's
 Voyager of the Seas that docked in Sydney on March 18    Officers
 from Thursday will have the power to issue fines of $1000 to 
individuals and $5000 to businesses that breach public health orders or 
ministerial directions.   People in the firing line include returned
 travellers who contravene the requirement to self-quarantine for 14 
days and those diagnosed with COVID-19 who similarly don't follow the 
rules.    Federal border authorities have blamed NSW Health for
 the Ruby Princess cruise ship fiasco, where infected passengers were 
allowed into Sydney before test results were known.    Foreign
 backpackers have been ignoring strict coronavirus self-isolation 
orders, stepping off their international flights and rushing out to get 
tattoos.   Local customers also flocked to tattoo studios on the 
last night they could get themselves inked in Australia but few wanted a
 permanent reminder of COVID-19.   All tattoo parlours were forced 
to cease trading at midnight on Thursday under the same health 
regulations that shut down businesses including tanning, waxing and nail
 salons.   Quarantine has been one theme of COVID-19 tattoos.
 Despite warnings to international visitors that they must self-isolate 
for 14 days after arriving in Australia, backpackers have been reported 
to be going straight from the airport to get a tattoo    Rather
 than being inundated with new patrons, some studios reported a surge in
 regular clients, many of whom wanted to complete half-finished jobs.   Most
 last-minute customers were not asking for Corona bottles or other 
COVID-19 mementos but Instagram is already filled with tattoos featuring
 those themes.   Owners had no idea when they would be able to 
reopen, with workers at one studio considering whether they should 
donate its medical supplies to a hospital.    Vic Market Tattoo Shop in Melbourne's CBD, which has seven artists including Wade Johnston, closed on Monday ahead of the ban.   Toilet
 paper rolls appear regularly in coronavirus tattoos. Local tattooist 
said most of their customers on the last legal day of trading did not 
want a reminder of the deadly virus    'The main issue that we all ran into was new tourists wanting to get tattooed,' Mr Johnston said.   'We
 had at least five separate cases of backpackers who had just gotten off
 international flights wanting to get tattooed, obviously ignoring 
self-isolation guidelines.'   All foreign nationals who arrived in Australia before 9pm last Friday have been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.   Coronavirus
 tattoos have been appearing since the outbreak of the disease became 
global news. Corona beer bottles have been a popular COVID-19   After that time only Australian citizens, residents and immediate families have been allowed to enter the country.   Like
 other studio operators Mr Johnston said the Australian tattoo industry 
was already highly regulated and followed safe cross-contamination 
practices.   'So I'd say the industry, as a whole, takes this pretty seriously.'   This
 studio had tourists wanting tattoos when they should be in quarantine. 
'We had at least five separate cases of backpackers who had just gotten 
off international flights wanting to get tattooed, obviously ignoring 
self isolation guidelines,' artist Wade Johnston said   Jamie 
Kirchen, who owns Hunter and Fox Tattoo at Beaconsfield in Sydney's 
inner southern suburbs, said he faced Wednesday night with a 'heavy 
heart'.   'I didn't get home to my family until 1.30am as I live on the south coast and chose to tattoo until I could,' Mr Kirchen said.   'All
 our artists managed to stay until cut-off time last night, fitting in 
our loyal customers before we had to close the doors.'   Surviving
 the deadly COVID-19 threat crops up in coronavirus tattoos (left). 
Another tattoo shows the virus as the sun behind a palm tree above the 
word 'coronafornia' (right)   Mr Kirchen, who had been 
tattooing for 11 years, was grateful to his staff for 'sticking tight 
and smashing out two days worth of work in one.'   'This is our 
livelihood. I have kids to feed and a mortgage to pay, without work this
 will be tricky so it was a bittersweet night.   'It was great to 
see our clients flocking in to get their appointments met before we shut
 down but a sickening feeling for the unknown.   'Our adrenaline was
 pumping the whole time, posting on social media to get clients in 
before 12am - emails, phone calls - but at the same time trying to limit
 crowds by adhering to one person per every four square metres.'  "

 two states have the highest infection rates in the country, with 
confirmed cases in NSW exploding to 1,405 on Friday - almost half the 
national total of 3,112.   NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said she 
was 'looking very closely' at the impact of the Federal Government's 
closure of pubs, restaurants and other businesses - and is prepared to 
declare a state-wide lockdown by the weekend if infections didn't tail 
off.     'If we don't see things shifting in the numbers 
because of [the Federal Government's] actions, NSW will have to go 
Afurther,' she said on Thursday.     Scroll down for video     Victoria

 saying to the community that if we're not convinced we've had a 
sufficient amount of success, NSW will have to take further action and 
that's a position I've been clear on from day one.'    Ms Berejiklian
 warned NSW residents to 'be prepared' for state-implemented 
restrictions, which could include confining people to their homes and 
only allowing them to leave for basic necessities.    'There's no need to panic,' Ms Berejiklian said. 'Supermarkets and essential things will still be available.'    It is believed state-enforced restrictions will be discussed at the National Cabinet meeting on Friday.    Ahead
 of the meeting, Victoria's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos indicated the 
state was looking to implement its own measures to stop the virus from 
spreading.    'Everybody must understand that it is time to make some sacrifices if we are to save lives,' Ms AMikakos said.    NSW
 premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was 'looking very closely' at the 
impact of the Federal Government's closure of pubs, restaurants and

worst-affected areas confined to their homes - only allowed to go out 
for basic supplies   Victoria's Chief Health Officer 
Brett Sutton refused to confirm or deny she'd advised Premier Daniel 
Andrews to plunge the state into lockdown.    'The Premier will
 take that case to National Cabinet and they'll make a call. I think if 
any of us Afailed the elderly, youth in one suburb or another, in 
regional Victoria or metro  Melbourne , then we all fail ourselves,' he said.    As
 the states consider moving ahead of the Commonwealth towards lockdown, 
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said they were jumping the gun.   The
 full effect of the second stage of Federal Government shutdowns - in 
place from Thursday - wouldn't be known for some days, he said.    'It
 does take us at least seven and possibly 14 days to really get a 
picture... remember we also have to take out the fact we have returning 
travellers come in with disease,' Dr Chant said on Thursday.    A woman wears a mask to protect against coronavirus    The number of NSW coronavirus cases jumped on Friday to 1,405.   Some 16 patients are in intensive care, with 10 requiring ventilators.   Two
 more children in NSW on Thursday - girls aged one and two - were 
confirmed to have COVID-19, taking the number of child cases to 
four.    Meanwhile, five people in NSW, including a returned 
traveller from Bali, have been issued Australia's first  
infringement notices for breaching COVID-19 public health orders.    Police
 from Thursday had the power to hand out fines of $1000 to individuals 
and $5000 to businesses that breach public health orders or ministerial 
directions.   The 65-year-old woman returned to  Sydney  from Bali on Saturday and was told she was subject to a public health order and was required to quarantine for 14 days.   Police
 received information she has contravened the public health order and on
 Monday visited her home in Redhead, south of Newcastle, and issued her 
with a warning for breaching the order.   Officers received further information she had left her home on Thursday morning and was in breach of the order.   At about 1.45pm on Thursday officers returned to the woman's home and issued her with a $1000 penalty infringement notice.   A cruise ship passenger has died from coronavirus, taking Australia's death toll to 13.   The man in his 70s died in Joondalup Hospital in Perth on Thursday.   It
 was initially reported that he had been on board the Ruby Princess 
cruise ship that docked in Sydney, however Daily Mail Australia 
understands that is not the case.   A cruise ship passenger has died from coronavirus, taking Australia's death toll to 13    He
 is the third passenger on board the ship to die of coronavirus, after a
 woman in her 70s passed away on Tuesday and a man in his 60s died on 
Wednesday.    The man is the second Australian to die from coronavirus in Western Australia.    A
 massage parlour on Sussex St in Sydney's CBD was identified on Thursday
 as still operating, in contravention of a public health order.   The female owner of the business was issued with a $5000 penalty infringement notice.   Three female staff members were also given $1000 notices.   'No
 one is above the law. If you decide to ignore a direction, you will be 
caught, and you may very well find yourself slapped with a hefty fine,' 
Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott said in a 
statement on Thursday.   'The fact that people are still not complying is the reason why we have police out in full force enforcing these directions.   'This behaviour is not only reckless and stupid, but potentially deadly.'    On
 Wednesday night, the government were due to discuss 'stage three' 
restrictions in a national cabinet meeting.     Nobody 
knows exactly what the next stage will entail - but experts have told 
Daily Mail Australia that more extreme social distancing measures are 
inevitable.   'Distancing can be more extreme and restrictions can 
be made tougher. Watch this space,' said Stephen Leeder, a Professor of 
Public Health at Sydney University.    Schools     Prime
 Minister Scott Morrison said that he wants schools to stay open so 
essential workers do not have to worry about childcare and children can 
continue their education.   He said the health risk of keeping 
schools open was low because young people are not vulnerable to 
coronavirus - but some teachers fear they are 'cannon fodder' and want 
the gates closed for their own safety.    Paul Komesaroff, 
Professor of Medicine at Monash University, told Daily Mail Australia 
that closing the schools would be a logical step.   'The next thing 
to do is to close schools and universities,' he said. 'But that is a big
 step because it may impact whether parents can go to work.'   In 
Norway and the UK, schools have been kept open for the children of 
essential workers such as doctors and nurses and something similar could
 be arranged in Australia.   Restaurants, cafes and food 
courts will be restricted to takeaway service only. Pictured: An empty 
dining area in the once busy strip of restaurants Barangaroo    Some states are already moving towards closing schools by bringing forward holidays.   Tasmania's school term will end four days early so teachers can prepare online education resources.   Victoria
 has also closed its schools early, sending 1million pupils home three 
days before the Easter break which starts this Friday in the state.   Meanwhile,
 the NSW Teachers Federation is calling for a planned transition to 
online learning across all state schools as attendance numbers continue 
to fall due to coronavirus fears.    Businesses     On
 Tuesday night, Mr Morrison announced a raft of businesses that would 
need to close their doors, putting thousands of Australians out of work.   Personal
 service businesses 'where there is a lot of contact', such as beauty 
therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons and tattoo parlours will be forced
 to shut.    Personal service businesses 'where there is
 a lot of contact', such as beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons
 and tattoo parlours are being forced to shut   But 
hairdressers and barbershops are allowed to remain open as well as food 
markets and shopping centres, except for the food courts.   These businesses could be in the firing line if the government moves further towards a lock down.   In
 an extreme scenario, only critical businesses such as petrol stations, 
pharmacies and grocery stores would need to remain open.     Exercise    Mr Morrison announced on Tuesday that social sports such as large groups of people playing soccer in a park have been banned.   But he said that boot camps and personal training will be allowed to go ahead with less then 10 people.   Yoga
 and barre sessions, as well as spinning and other exercise sessions, 
can continue so long as they abide by the 10 people or fewer rule as 
well.    These types of exercise classes could be next on the chopping block.   Professor Komesaroff said Australia could eventually follow the lead of other countries and ban group exercise outside the home.   'We could see rules where you are only allowed out of your home for a run. Or maybe we won't even be allowed out as in China.'   Gym
 goers are training outside after fitness clubs and recreation centres 
were force to shut under new coronavirus health measures. Professor
 Komesaroff said Australia could eventually follow the lead of other 
countries and ban all exercise outside the home   He added: 'I
 personally can't see a problem with some-one running on the street 
alone because there's no risk of transmission if they are not in a 
group.'    Shopping     Grocery shops will always stay open because people need to buy food.   But there could be limits imposed on the number of people allowed in a supermarket at one time.   Shops
 could also require customers to better observe social distancing by 
limiting the number of people in aisles and making them stand two metres
 apart.    In Italy, for example, shoppers are forced to wait in 'socially distanced' queues just to go to the supermarket.   'Supermarkets need to have social distancing,' Professor Komesaroff said.   'They
 might limit the number of people and have them two metres apart when 
they queue. That kind of process is inevitable,' he said.    Gatherings     In Italy, for example, shoppers are forced to wait in 'socially distanced' queues just to go to the supermarket.   Yoga
 and barre sessions, as well as spinning and other exercise sessions, 
can continue so long as they abide by the 10 people or fewer rule as 
well   'Supermarkets need to have social distancing,' Professor Komesaroff said.   'They
 might limit the number of people and have them two metres apart when 
they queue. That kind of process is inevitable,' he said.    Professor Komesaroff said such measures would help slow the spread of the coronavirus.   'We're
 right at the start of a catastrophic upsurge and we know that the 
infection numbers will increase drastically,' he warned.   'The minute the health service overwhelms, the death rate will increase dramatically. I don't think we can be overconfident.'   He
 said a requirement for people to show police a letter explaining why 
they have left home would likely be considered in the final stage of 
measures - not in stage three.  "

unfortunately now resulted in a cluster of cases from an exclusive Aspen
 Ski resort.      Victorian health authorities have 
been monitoring the Colorado ski trip cluster, with dozens of 
Ainfections believed to have stemmed from one group visit.     It
 is believed that one of the children of the group had been travelling 
around the world before visiting them in Aspen and transmitting the 
virus.     One man who interacted with the alpine ski set is now fighting for his life in a Melbourne hospital.

Aspen took the virus to Queensland, where they attended the 50th 
birthday party of property magnate Glen Wright who founded the charity 
GIVIT, the Courier Mail reported.   The lavish party was held at the Sails restaurant in Noosa, which has become the state's largest coronavirus cluster.   Up

 of the guests were mothers of girls who attend Brisbane's elite private

Manly
 Beach, on Sydney's northern beaches, was flooded with hundreds of 
joggers, cyclists, surfers and sunbathers on Friday.    Despite
 clear instructions to remain at home as much as possible and avoid 
crowded areas to slow the spread of the virus, people were spotted 
clustered together.   Former  Married at First Sight  star and Manly resident Dean Wells also shared footage of the area flooded with visitors throughout the day.   'Literally thousands of people around,' he wrote in a post on Instagram.   The
 shocking footage comes as Australia's coronavirus cases skyrocket to

 ignored 1.5metre social distancing guidelines on Friday and Saturday as
 they lay together on the sand and helped each other apply sunscreen.   Pictures
 of crowds soon emerged on Instagram showing a lack of concern for 
social distancing rules, with many of the young sun-worshippers even 
making jokes about the virus.    The government has been urging everyone to keep at least 1.5metres apart to slow the spread of the deadly virus.    Extreme
 measures have been brought in as the number of cases continues to rise,
 including a travel ban, as well as a ban on mass gatherings.   Despite
 the clear instructions to remain at home as much as possible and avoid 
crowded areas to slow the spread of the virus, many people were spotted 
clustered together   The government has been urging 
Australians to stay home as much as possible and avoid busy areas to 
slow the spread of the virus, however, Manly residents still flocked to 
the beach   Central Sydney, Woollahra, Waverley and the 
city's northern beaches have been revealed as hotspots for the 
coronavirus in New South Wales. The virus has infected more than 1,200 
people across the state   On Friday afternoon, Scott Morrison 
announced Australians arriving home from overseas will be forced to
 serve out their two week self-isolation in hotels policed by the 
military.   Mr Morrison said Australia is battling both a virus and 
economic crisis, describing the latter as 'devastating'. He announced 
the Federal government is working on a third stimulus package to help 
businesses 'hibernate' through a six month shutdown period.    Weddings have been limited to five people and funerals to just 10, with auction houses and open homes closed.    Former
 Married at First Sight star and Manly resident Dean Wells also shared 
footage of the area flooded with visitors throughout the day   Pubs
 and gyms have been forced to close, while cafes and restaurants have 
been restricted to offering a takeaway service only.    Many 
retailers have now made the decision to close stores as foot traffic 
continues to decline and people opt for online purchases instead.   Solomon
 Lew's Premier Investments, which owns General Pants, Smiggle, and 
Peter Alexander, shut all its Australian stores at 6pm on Thursday.   Around 9,000 of the company's staff around the world will be stood down without pay until at least April 22.   The
 company said it does not intend to pay rent on any of its stores. 
Around 70 per cent of its leases in Australia and New Zealand run out 
this year or are already expired.   The group's bosses will be working from home without pay.   Crowds are seen on Bondi Beach ahead of its closure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on March 21   The
 shocking footage comes as Australia's coronavirus cases skyrocket to 
3,112, with 13 people killed and the economy brought to a shuddering 
halt   RAG Group, which owns Tarocash, YD and Connor, is closing 500 stores and standing down 3,000 workers from 5pm on Friday.   New South Wales: 2,182   Victoria: 968   Queensland: 781   Western Australia: 364   South Australia: 337   Australian Capital Territory: 84   Tasmania: 69   Northern Territory: 19    TOTAL CASES:  4,804     RECOVERED: 355     DEAD: 20      Meanwhile,
 Accent Group - which owns Athlete's Foot, Platypus and Hype - has 
announced it is closing 522 stores and standing down around 5,000 staff.   The company will close all stores from 5pm on Friday for four weeks.   During
 the stand down period, employees will continue to accrue entitlements 
and may access their annual and long service leave entitlements.   ALH pub group has stood down 8,000 workers and jeweller Michael Hill has told 2,500 people they no longer have a job.   Flight Centre has announced 3,800 job losses in Australia - and 6,000 globally - after the Prime Minister banned going overseas.   Thousands of Australians have already been left without work as a result of the changes.    Sydney's south east has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 319 people in the area catching the deadly virus   Thousands
 of hospitality workers were out of work from Monday when the prime 
minister announced the new measures (pictured: People lining up outside 
Centrelink this week)   Centrelink offices have been flooded with desperate Aussies hoping to get the job seeker benefit.     The government has been working to soften the blow to the economy, pledging to support workers who lose their jobs.    Scott
 Morrison announced an extra $66billion worth of spending on Sunday, 
bringing the total survival package to $189billion - or 10 percent of 
Australia's GDP.   A series of bills was approved on Monday night, 
with two packages worth $17.6billion and $66billion at the heart of the 
Morrison government's response.   In separate legislation, the 
government set aside a further $40billion for urgent and unforeseen 
spending associated with the pandemic, likely to cause a 
recession.     Peter Alexander is among the stores that is having to close down due to the coronavirus   Smiggle is also owned by Solomon Lew's Premier Investments which announced the shut down   General Pants is closing all stores until at least April 22 due to the coronavirus fallout   Restaurants
 on Melbourne's popular Chapel Street have been forced to resort to 
takeaway services only, in light of the new restrictions    The
 government will no longer need legislation to make changes to welfare 
settings after passing an amendment to the package, giving the social 
services minister unprecedented powers.   The money is to help 
businesses survive the shutdown, and to help people buy food and pay 
their bills through an extended period when they might be unable to work
 due to quarantines and lockdowns.   It includes wage subsidies so 
businesses can keep staff on the payroll even when money is not coming 
in, and early superannuation access for people struggling to make ends 
meet. A number of welfare payments almost doubled.   Banks have also offered a six-month repayment holiday for mortgage holders.

 member of the Colorado coronavirus cluster, a group of wealthy skiers 
from Melbourne, has broken her silence after the group was accused of 
infecting dozens of Australians.   Eliza Honan travelled with 
friends and family to Aspen in America, the go-to skiing destination for
 the world's rich and famous, and returned on March 13.   But she said that upon returning to Melbourne, she immediately self-isolated and did not attend any events.   The
 group - which included a successful businessman and a former state 
treasurer - has been linked to a coronavirus outbreak sweeping across 
Melbourne's richest suburbs.   Dozens who came into contact with 
members of the group are believed to have been infected while attending 
exclusive school cocktail parties in Toorak and Armadale.    Marketing analyst Eliza Honan (pictured) had been holidaying in Aspen when she caught coronavirus   The
 cluster broke out at a party at a luxury ski apartment in Aspen, hosted
 by former Liberal Party treasurer Andrew Abercrombie on March 2, 
with around 40 people attending.     Two people who had 
contact with the jet-setters have since been put on ventilators after 
contracting the killer respiratory disease.     Ms Honan, 
who attended the party with her parents, said she isolated as soon as 
she arrived back in Australia after developing flu-like symptoms.   'On
 returning to Melbourne from the US with flu symptoms I immediately 
self-isolated and saw a GP as soon as possible, insisting I be tested 
for COVID-19.   'I Having tested positive for COVID-19, I cooperated fully with health authorities and remained isolated at home.   The virus is sweeping through Melbourne's rich suburbs after a group of skiers returned from Colorado    Aspen
 in Colorado is a ski resort for the rich and famous. It has also been 
linked to the spread of the coronavirus (stock image)   'Since arriving back in Melbourne, I have not attended any gatherings or social events.'   She added that Australians should stay at home to honour the work being done by doctors and nurses across the country.   One man infected with COVID-19 is now fighting for his life in hospital after mixing with the group.   Another
 mixed with the jet-setters at a Geelong Grammar parents' cocktail party
 in Toorak, had been on a ventilator - but has since 
recovered.     Around 30 people were infected at a luxury 
restaurant in Noosa after a 50th birthday party which was linked to the 
Aspen group.     Queensland Health confirmed four staff 
members continued to work at Sails Restaurant in Noosa while they were 
unknowingly infectious.    There have been 14 deaths from coronavirus in Australia, with 3,573 cases recorded nationwide   Sails,
 in Noosa (pictured) , was hit by the virus reportedly after being 
visited by some of the Aspen cluster, which has been linked to the 
outbreak in Melbourne   Flexigroup chairman and former state politician Mr Abercrombie and his wife Shadda have since both tested negative to the virus.

Other members of the trip included entrepreneur Sophie Carnegie-Cooper and her partner and debt expert Michael Backwell.   Authorities believe the infections originated from a child of one of the members of the group, who had visited them in Aspen.    Health
 authorities are urgently checking Melburnians who had contact with the 
Aspen group, which included successful business people and members of 
the social elite.    On Thursday, data revealed the posh 
municipality of Stonnington, which includes leafy suburbs such as Toorak
 and Armadale, had 57 confirmed cases of the virus.   The Mornington
 Peninsula, which includes posh Portsea and Sorrento, has the next 
highest number, with 36 cases, while the City of Melbourne has 32.    The Herald Sun this week reported Portsea residents were furious with members of the Aspen cluster.   On Thursday, Mr Abercrombie broke his silence after being linked to the scandal.    A spokeswoman for Mr Abercrombie told the  Herald Sun  he had tested negative to coronavirus tests both in the US and back in Australia on his return.     London

 had isolated themselves within the ski village after hearing someone 
they had been in contact with there had contracted the virus.    After
 being cleared by US authorities to return to Melbourne, they were 
tested for coronavirus by authorities here and again tested 
negative.    'He has twice tested negative for COVID-19 and on 
Thursday received a notice from VicHealth confirming his isolation 
period is over,' Mr Abercrombie's spokeswoman told the newspaper.    The couple, while in good health, continued to isolate themselves in Melbourne for the required 14-day period.      He also clarified he had not been in Portsea since leaving for overseas in February.    Daily
 Mail Australia is not suggesting Mr Abercrombie or any others mentioned
 were flouting restrictions on people returning overseas.   Shadda

her husband when coronavirus came to town. They have returned to 
Australia and recently got out of isolation   On Thursday, Portsea residents hit out at people they believed were spreading the virus.    'It's astonishing and people down here are just appalled,' one Portsea local, who asked not to be named, told the  Herald Sun .    One
 member of the cluster, who remained anonymous, confirmed she had 
been infected with the virus, but had self isolated.    'I've been cleared by the Health Department since last Friday,' she said.   'We are the responsible ones in this and people have nothing better to do than be nasty.   'I'll tell you what, if we lived in Box Hill and I'd been to Bali no-one would care, would they?'

(pictured) and his wife had been holidaying at a ski resort in Aspen 
when coronavirus hit   At least five Geelong Grammar parents 
contracted the virus at a cocktail party for a TimberAtop family earlier
 this month and a snowboarder also has it.    It also has 
spread to others via a 21st birthday party and been blamed for 
potentially dozens of cases across Melbourne's wealthy inner east and 
southeast.   The rapid spread of the disease has caused disputes 
among guests at the party, who claim the woman should have immediately 
placed herself into isolation when she returned to Melbourne a day 
earlier.    It is understood about 80 guests attended the function.    At that point, the woman had not experienced any symptoms and had not been tested.    The
 woman's son sent an SMS message on March 22 to former students of 
Scotch College warning of potential exposure to the virus.     It
 is understood the pair were tested at Frankston Hospital on March 15, 
but claimed they were later spotted at shops in Sorrento and a nearby 
golf course.     IndivAiduals face fines of up to $20,000 each if they don't take steps to prevent the virus spreading.    Some of Australia's wealthiest suburbs are  coronavirus  hotspots after residents brought the virus back on first class flights, luxury cruises and a skiing trip to Aspen.     As
 of Friday morning, 93 of Victoria's 520 confirmed cases were in 
the affluent areas of Stonnington and the Mornington Peninsula, The 
Australian reported.    Wealthy suburbs Toorak and South Yarra 
are in Stonnington, while the seaside havens of Portsea and Sorrento, 
where the rich have their holiday homes, are on  the Mornington Peninsula.     Aspen, Colorado, is the ski resort of the rich and famous, popular among the wealthy Toorak-Portsea set (stock image)    Toorak-Portsea
 residents are fond of skiing in Aspen, Colorado, which has 
unfortunately now resulted in a cluster of cases from an exclusive Aspen
 Ski resort.      Victorian health authorities have 
been monitoring the Colorado ski trip cluster, with dozens of 
Ainfections believed to have stemmed from one group visit.     It
 is believed that one of the children of the group had been travelling 
around the world before visiting them in Aspen and transmitting the 
virus.     One man who interacted with the alpine ski set is now fighting for his life in a Melbourne hospital.

coronavirus outbreak after one of the Aspen set came. His brother Peter

with up to 30 guests   Another person who went skiing in Aspen
 took the virus to Queensland, where they attended the 50th birthday 
party of property magnate Glen Wright who founded the charity GIVIT, the
 Courier Mail reported.   The lavish party was held at the Sails restaurant in Noosa, which has become the state's largest coronavirus cluster.   Up
 to 30 people who attended the party including staff and Mr Wright's 
brother Peter, a butcher, all tested positive for the virus.   Three
 of the guests were mothers of girls who attend Brisbane's elite private
 school, St Margaret's in Ascot, an exclusive suburb in Brisbane's inner
 north.     While the Colorado ski trip cluster may have infected hundreds of people, it has by no means been the only source of infection.   A
 NSW Health Department list shows more than 20 international flights in 
just one month - from 22 February to March 21 - where people came in 
close contact with an infected passenger in first or business 
class.    The Ruby Princess departing Sydney on March 19

 Eastern Suburbs, which include the exclusive suburbs of Vaucluse, Point
 Piper, Rose Bay and Bellevue Hill, had recorded 319 cases of 
coronavirus as of Tuesday.   Waverley, which includes Bondi, Bronte and Queens Park, recorded 105 cases.   Bondi's
 outbreak is not only confined to wealthy circles as there has been an 
outbreak among backpackers who have flown in from 
overseas.      Sydney's inner city accountsA for 91 
cases, and there are 247 cases on the north shore, with the expensive 
Northern Beaches also one of the virus hotspots.   Luxury cruises popular among retirees have also become the gateway for coronavirus to enter Australia.    Half
 of South Australia's 38 new cases of coronavirus come from the cruise 
ship Ruby Princess which docked in Sydney on March 19 after a tour of 
New Zealand, bringing the state's total to 235 as of Friday.   Western
 Australia's first death from coronavirus was a man in his 70s who had 
been reported to have been a passenger on the Ruby Princess but had 
instead travelled on another vessel.   Bondi Beach in

 years after the 2008 global economic crisis the future of the European 
bloc is in question again as the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deep 
internal divisions at a time when a common solution is needed, economic 
observers say, predicting the potential demise of the EU.   On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron warned EU member states that the coronavirus crisis  may shatter the pillars of the bloc  and bring an end to the no-border Schengen Zone unless the countries in the union demonstrate solidarity.   ""Whatas at stake is the survival of the European project"", Macron 
told his fellow EU leaders during a conference call on 26 March. ""The 
risk we are facing is the death of Schengen"".   On 17 March, European leaders announced that they had agreed to shut 
the EUas external borders down for 30 days in a bid to slow the 
coronavirus spread. However, 14 of the bloc's 27 members have closed 
their internal borders either completely or partially thus throwing the 
EU no-border concept into question.   Likewise, EU member states have failed to reach a compromise on 
debt-sharing amid the COVID-19-driven economic slowdown. Nine EU 
countries, namely, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, 
Portugal, Greece, and Slovenia are urging the union to issue so-called 
""corona bonds"", i.e. a common debt instrument aimed at raising funds on 
the market. The so-called ""Frugal Four"" - Germany, the Netherlands, 
Austria, and Finland  are resisting the measure.   aObservers are  sounding  the
 alarm over the unfolding split within the Eurozone, suggesting that 
though the 2008 financial crisis fell short of axing the bloc's common 
currency the coronavirus crisis might end with the breakup of the EU.   Paolo Raffone, a strategic analyst and director of the CIPI 
Foundation in Brussels, warns that the collapse of the Schengen 
agreement will have ""a tremendous negative impact on citizensa lives and
 economic sectors"".   The CIPI director feels that the 2008 crisis ""has never really ended,
 but it has structurally created a deep divide between the countries 
that ought to live in solidarity, cooperation, and growth"".   According to the strategic analyst, on 26 March, 27 EU member states 
""practically certified the failure of the basic principles and pillars 
of the EU integration process"".   ""Germany, followed by the Netherlands and almost all former eastern 
bloc states, has decided to take, as the French newspaper 'Liberation' 
wrote, its 'pound of flesh', that is to say to make Southern Europe pay 
the debts,  Italy in the lead "", he underscores.   And this is happening at a time when Italy,  one of the most-affected nations 
 in the world in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, is struggling to stay 
afloat. Raffone draws attention to the fact that while Germany ""produces
 and has tens of thousands of respiratory fans and the ability to do 
360,000 tests on the virus per week"", it is not sharing this capacity 
with other EU nations. ""It is the most selfish enduring asymmetry ever!""
 argues the strategic analyst.   For his part, Dr Giovanni Di Lieto, lecturer in international 
business and economics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, 
believes that the European Union is now at the ""make it or break it"" 
moment.   According to Di Lieto it won't happen overnight but cracks between 
Nordic European countries and their Southern and Mediterranean 
neighbours have already appeared. He does not rule out that the latter 
will start to create their own fiscal bonds, fiscal credits.   ""This essentially would create a separate currency, parallel currency
 to the euro, and it's pretty much the first step to having an exit of 
Italy from euro, the single currency"", he foresees.   On the other hand, the gradual breakup of the union may manifest 
itself in the loss of relevance of European treaties: ""So, in the short 
term we are going to go back to pre-Maastricht trade state in the 
European region and then probably we won't be talking any more of the 
European Union"", the lecturer alleges.   In the medium-term perspective one may expect an emergence of a 
French-led bloc across the Mediterranean and Western side of Europe and 
also a German-led block across Northern Europe with possibly even Nordic
 countries going their own way, according to the scholar.   ""A fair scenario could be that really all individual countries will 
go on their own, both economically, strategically and eventually also 
formally, in terms of national boundaries"", he says.   ""Now I don't see this happening, to be honest"", he adds.

6014739379,https://www.chron.com/news/article/4-ways-companies-can-support-their-workers-during-15168334.php,2020-03-31,4 ways companies can support their workers during the coronavirus crisis," Paula Caligiuri, Northeastern University   (The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)   Paula Caligiuri, Northeastern University and Helen De Cieri, Monash University   (THE CONVERSATION) The coronavirus pandemic has forced 
tens of millions of employees across the U.S. to work from home. While 
this will save lives by limiting the transmission of COVID-19, it also 
poses significant challenges for employeesa well-being.   How can companies support the health of their employees a
 many of whom have never before worked from home for a significant 
amount of time?   As researchers in the area of human resource management, 
we have studied companiesa ability to adopt and encourage practices to 
improve employeesa well-being.   Here are four research-backed ways we believe companies can promote employeesa health and well-being during this crisis.   1. Provide more flexibility   Before the pandemic, only about 5% of the U.S. workforce worked from home on a regular basis.   But working from home affects every employee differently 
depending on their responsibilities and living situations. For example, 
with widespread school and childcare closures, workers with younger 
children need to balance keeping them occupied while trying to keep up 
with work tasks. And the same goes for those with elder-care 
responsibilities.   Thatas why employer flexibility to match specific employee needs is crucial.   A good step is for companies to require managers to have 
open conversations with their employees about how and when work can be 
accomplished a without intruding on employeesa privacy a and offer a 
wider range of options for flexibility, such as more leeway when 
assignments need to be turned in or adjusting work hours per day to 
allow more time to care for children and others.   Itas also important for this order to come from the top because not all managers view flexibility positively.   For workers in states where they can still head to the 
office, companies should also offer more flexibility, such as reduced 
hours, a compressed  work week or even a leave of absence.   And employees should not be passive. Let your managers 
know what kinds of flexibility you need to balance your work and home 
lives.   2. Encourage and host virtual social time   For workers who have never worked from home, social 
isolation will be deeply felt. Itas hard to replicate daily interactions
 with co-workers, casual encounters by the water cooler or after-work 
drinks.   Research has found that having such reciprocal, 
supportive interactions with work colleagues is linked to worker 
well-being. But companies should not assume this will happen naturally, 
especially when people are feeling down.   Employers should encourage their workers to find time to 
have virtual coffees, lunches or even happy hours with their colleagues.
 And managers could continue to mark birthdays or other milestones with 
video conference calls and other methods.   Another idea is to sponsor group games a such as Quiz 
Breaker, Water Cooler Trivia or Wonder Polls a that employees can play 
together for some downtime.   3. Train for online collaboration   Itas easy to presume that employees will be effective 
working remotely as long as they have the right technological tools, 
such as video cameras and chatting software.   But research has found itas not that simple, and 
conflicts can emerge as a result of the different ways people prefer to 
communicate and use technology. Some workers may prefer communicating 
over email, while others react most quickly to chat programs like Slack.
 For others, the best way to reach them is with an old-fashioned phone 
call. Some of our own work has found that remote work can exacerbate the
 problem, particularly in times of stress.   To address this, companies can offer web-based sessions 
on the most effective ways to work online. During these sessions, 
leaders can establish ground rules for the use of collaborative 
technology and build awareness of individual and cultural differences in
 communication, including preferences for email, phone calls and 
conference calls.   4. Foster positive coping   The pandemic is increasing peopleas fear and stress levels, which can have fatal consequences.   The National Suicide Prevention Hotline has experienced 
an unprecedented jump in calls and even chatbot counseling apps have 
seen an uptick in recent weeks.   Our research has shown that people use a wide variety of 
coping strategies when they are in a new and stressful situations. Some,
 such as increased alcohol consumption, are not very healthy.   In normal times, companies can offer a variety of ways to
 support employee mental and physical health, from social activities to 
gym memberships. But with workers at home and the fitness centers 
closed, companies need to redirect their efforts to foster employee 
well-being.   Fortunately, there are plenty of apps and websites that 
can act as temporary substitutions. Employers can help by directing 
their employees to the ones theyave vetted a and offering to foot the 
bill.   Weave found that practicing mindfulness a focusing your 
attention to be fully present in the moment a can be especially 
beneficial to employeesa mental health, even among highly stressed 
nurses and other health care workers. Companies can help a and some

 experts believe research showing the spread of influenza can be 
suppressed by regulating indoor humidity could help combat coronavirus.   WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMIDITY AND FLU   *
 At humidity levels of 23 per cent, up to 77 per cent of flu virus 
particles coughed into a room were still able to cause an infection an 
hour later, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.   * When humidity levels were raised to 43 per cent, 
just 14 per cent of the virus particles had the ability to infect. Most 
became inactive 15 minutes after being released into the humid air.   WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMIDITY AND COVID-19   *
 Data collected by China's Nanjing University from more than 500 
locations across the globe between January 20 and March 11 suggests 
weather including relative humidity is a factor in the spread of the 
contagion.   * Researchers from Madrid's National Museum of Natural
 Sciences and the University of Helsinki are reporting that tropical 
parts of the globe seem least affected by the pandemic.   WHAT OUR EXPERTS SAY   *

potentially be the same and (what we know) could help. But I'd be 
cautious."" Professor Michael Beard, deputy director Adelaide University

 the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed like influenza by regulating
 indoor humidity need to be investigated, say Australian experts.   The
 theory is based on 2013 research showing patients are safer from the 
flu in a room set at higher relative humidity than a dry one.   The
 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found more than 75 
per cent of influenza particles were able to cause infection an hour 
after being coughed into an area where humidity levels were 23 per cent.   When the levels were raised to 43 per cent, just 14 per cent of the particles were infectious.   While
 potentially significant, Adelaide University Research Centre for 
Infectious Disease deputy director Michael Beard says the idea 
humidification might subdue COVID-19 needs analysis.   ""It seems to
 be that this virus is a little bit hardier or a little more resistant 
to some of the external forces that might cause it to degrade,"" he says.   ""I
 think influenza is a lot more susceptible to changes in temperature and
 humidty. But I think this is a really good starting point.""   While it's far from settled science, evidence has emerged that the coronavirus prefers dry conditions.   Data
 collected by Nanjing University from more than 500 locations across the
 globe since late January suggests weather, including relative humidity,
 is a factor in the spread of the contagion.   Researchers from universities in Madrid and Helsinki are also reporting that tropical parts of the globe seem least affected.   That's
 enough to indicate one of the best ways to combat COVID-19 is to set 
humidity levels inside hospitals, schools, offices and homes between 40 
and 60 per cent, claims American researcher Stephanie Taylor.   ""As
 human beings we don't do well in dry air and quickly-mutating viruses 
and bacteria do,"" says the Harvard Medical School and architecture 
graduate who also hosts a daily coronavirus Youtube blog.   The 
more moisture in the air, the harder for airborne pathogens to land 
beyond the 1.5m zone which constitutes our 'personal space' and to keep 
settling and resuspending which makes surfaces hard to sterilise, she 
says.   They also die off faster.   At the same time, our skin
 doesn't dry and crack, our lungs better repel the pathogens that fasten
 themselves via our airways and our organs don't weaken due to 
dehydration.   Dr Taylor says the problem especially during winter 
is that we come inside, put our heaters on and push humidity levels down
 to 20 per cent.   Extrapolating what's known about the flu and applying it to coronavirus might work, Prof Beard concedes.   ""I
 think the data is relatively strong for influenza so it could 
potentially be the same and (what we know) could help,"" he told AAP.   ""But I'd be cautious.""   Monash University's Professor Paul Komesaroff agrees.   ""It's
 been an issue that's important enough to think through in terms of the 
flu virus, so there's no reason why one wouldn't pursue it in relation 
to the coronavirus,"" he said.   ""It's clear we just don't know the answer at this stage but I would say it's ripe for research.""     Advertisement    "

 modelling suggests efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus in NSW
 could delay the peak period of infection until October but there would 
still be a massive shortage of ICU beds without ""urgent investment"".   If
 restrictions on movement reduce the reproduction rate to 1.6 - meaning 
each individual with the COVID-19 infects 1.6 others - the state's ICU 
capacity could still be overwhelmed later this year, an article 
published in the Medical Journal of Australia says.   ""Under the 
scenario of increased social isolation, the peak infection will shift to
 early October and peak ICU utilisation will shift to mid-November and 
would be around one-third the size of the business-as-usual peak,"" the 
authors wrote in an article published on Monday evening.   At that 
point, about five per cent of the population could be symptomatic, with 
more than 14,000 people in hospital across NSW and 5100 patients in 
intensive care.   ""This represents 585 per cent of the state's 
baseline ICU capacity prior to the epidemic,"" write the article's 
authors, who are from the University of Sydney, Monash University and 
James Cook University.   The infectious diseases modellers note 
that prior to the current coronavirus epidemic, there were 874 intensive
 care beds in NSW.   They argue that even with a doubling of 
existing services ""the available supply is estimated to be substantially
 less than the peak requirement"".   Hospitals and ICU facilities 
""are likely to be overwhelmed unless transmission can be reduced 
significantly"", the authors suggest, arguing there's a need for ""urgent 
investment in the resources required to support surge capacity for 
critical care services"".   Without social distancing measures, peak
 transmission would be much earlier, in late-June, with peak 
hospitalisation in early July, the modelling suggests.   Sixteen 
per cent of the population could be symptomatic with more than 35,000 
people hospitalised and close to 11,800 UCI beds needed. That's 1349 per
 cent of baseline capacity.   The authors admit, however, that their ""compartmental model"" approach has several limitations.   It depends upon assumptions including the current reproduction rate of the infection, which remains uncertain.   The authors acknowledge the trajectory of the epidemic will be highly dependent upon the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.   ""The
 present report does not estimate the effect of more intensive 
suppression strategies which would be likely to reduce the peak ICU 
requirement,"" they write.     Advertisement    "

This
 male, named Maratus constellatus, is no more than four millimeters in 
length and was spotted in the Little Desert National Park.   The 
colorful arachnid is one of seven new species of Peacock spiders, which 
are tiny, harmless creatures that are usually smaller than a grain of 
rice.   The new species were discovered by Joseph Schubert of  Australia's Museums Victoria , who has spent the past few years studying the Peacock spider.    Scroll down for video     A
 spider that resembles Vincent van Gogh's famous 'Starry Night' painting
 has been discovered in Australia. This male, named Maratus 
constellatus, is no more than four millimeters in length and was spotted
 in the Little Desert National Park   Pictured is Vincent van Gogh's famous painting 'Starry Night'   'Last
 year I traveled the country collecting specimens of these new peacock 
spiders (some discovered by citizen scientists!) and spent countless 
hours in the lab studying them,' Schubert tweeted on March 26. 'Some 
welcome news in tough times.'   The tiny Peacock spiders, or Maratus
 spiders, are native to Australia and are internet sensations for their 
elaborate courtship dances.   The spider, which has similar patterns
 to 'Starry Night,' is Maratus constellatus and was discovered in 
Western Australia, along with four other colorful species a Maratus 
azureus, Maratus inaquosus, Maratus laurenae, Maratus volpei, Maratus 
noggerup and Maratus suae.   Maratus volpei, was discovered in South Australia and Maratus inaquosus was identified in Victoria, bringing the total to seven.   The
 spider, which has similar patterns to 'Starry Night,' is Maratus 
constellatus (top right) and was discovered in Western Australia, along 
with four other colorful species a Maratus azureus (second on the 
bottom), Maratus inaquosus (third on the bottom), Maratus 
volpei (bottom left) Maratus laurenae, Maratus noggerup (top left) and 
Maratus suae (middle at the top)   The new species were named by spider taxonomist Joseph Schubert (pictured)   Schubert has described a total of 12 species of Peacock spiders since 2019 where he discovered five new ones.   'I
 would have to say Maratus constellatus is my favorite by far - it's 
such a nice looking species, the pattern reminds me of The Starry Night 
by Van Gogh. Plus I travelled a very, very long way to find it,' he 
explained.   The five species Schubert discovered in 2019 are known 
as as Maratus aquilus, Maratus felinus, and Maratus combustus, each 
identifiable by their distinctive patterns.    The Monash 
University research assistant made the discovery with a group of 
photographers from Project Maratus at Lake Jasper and Mount Romance in 
Western Australia's south-west.   He says arachnophobes have no reason to fear creepy critters.   'These little guys are completely harmless! They're roughly the length of a grain of rice,' Mr Schubert tweeted last year.   The
 five species Schubert discovered in 2019 are known as as Maratus 
aquilus, Maratus felinus, and Maratus combustus, each identifiable by 
their distinctive patterns The Maratus felinus peacock spider (pictured)
 can be identified by its cat like features   He told  10 daily : 'They're incredibly, small but so charismatic and so colourful.'   In
 his research findings, which were published in international scientific
 journal Zootaxa this week, Mr Schubert said each of the new species can
 be identified by the different markings on their abdomen.   The aquilus species refers to markings on the spider resembling an eagle's face seen from the front.   The felinus species has markings that resemble a cat.   The combustus species was named after its 'fiery explosion' pattern.   'These
 little guys are completely harmless,' spider taxonomist Joseph 
Schubert said. Pictured is the Maratus aquilus, named for its eagle
 like markings on the abdomen   The new species call Western  Australia's south-west home. Pictured is the Maratus combustus   Around 60 of the 74 peacock spider species have been discovered in the past 10 years, according to Mr Schubert's  research findings .   'This
 interest is driven by the unique courtship behaviour of the males of 
most species which display an elevated and often vibrantly coloured 
opisthosoma and third pair of legs to nearby females,' the report 
states.   Of all the peacock spider species, almost half can only be found in Western Australia's south-west.   'The
 Southwest Australia ecoregion is known as one of the planet's major 
biodiversity hotspots and a hotspot for peacock spider diversity,' Mr 
Schubert's report states.   "
